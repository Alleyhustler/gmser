        <h1>IMPOSSIBILITY OF FREE WILL</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I mentioned before, we don't have any free will as humankind. This
            is something you cannot even think about. It is a total mindfuck.
            "What you mean we don't have any free will?" you might ask. I will
            explain why we are not free on our choices and why "free will" is a
            faulty concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shit was boggling my mind for a long time. It is like your
            brain is programmed into not thinking this. But it is actually
            something very obvious. You did not choose to be who you are. You
            are molded into it. You did not choose your family, you did not
            choose your genetics, you did not choose your nationality, people
            you know, type of things you like, type of things you hate, your
            sexual preferences, your gender. You did not choose your mind
            either, you did not choose your mental capabilities or your iq. You
            did not choose your brain. You act the way you act because of your
            mind and memory which you did not choose. In these circumstances how
            can someone believe that they have any free will? "What about our
            soul?". We don't have any. We are all robots. All of our actions has
            been determined since the beginning of the universe. Well yes, i
            know determinism has been killed by quantum physics but how much
            impact really subatomic particles have in your life? I even heard
            some people saying "We have free will because determinism has been
            debunked". Even if we say that shit happens in subatomic levels has
            a huge impact on our lives, how the hell that proves we are totally
            free? That just proves our lives are controlled by random shit
            happening in subatomic levels and it is totally unpredictable.
            That's fucking worse if you ask me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before i create a huge mess lets get back to talking about soul.
            Soul is such a faulty concept as well. Maybe i don't understand it
            because i am an ignorant fucking heretic. But can anybody actually
            understand it? If we have a brain why we need a soul? Is soul a copy
            of your mind? I even heard people saying "Soul is your
            consciousness, this is why science cannot tell where the
            consciousness resides in your brain." Consciousness is not a
            physical thing. It is a human made term. It is hard to understand
            and people have all sorts of opinions about it. I just think that
            your consciousness is your brain and caused by communicaton of your
            neurons. It is not something you can take away from the brain and
            put into something else. It takes an entire brain to create
            consciousness. And no, science-fiction mumbo jumbo won't work
            either. Even if you create an exact copy of your brain it won't be
            you. Even if you somehow managed to charge the copycat brain with
            the electrical signals of your former brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consciousness is something abstract. When your physical brain has
            been damaged you are totally gone. Even if your soul has all of your
            memories or a detailed schematics of your brain it is not gonna save
            you. Your soul and newly built body free from material is just gonna
            be a copy of you. Your soul might have fun with virgins in heaven
            while your physical body and your actual self rotting under the
            dirt. You are totally gone, forever. There is no way to preserve the
            consciousness without preserving the organic brain. So, no afterlife
            for you. It is only possible if we are all living in a simulation.
            Because that way when you die it is only gonna be the fake image of
            your brain that is gonna disappear from existence. But claiming that
            religion has a concept of Matrix is a huge stretch. I just cannot
            put the pieces together. I don't understand how having a soul is
            gonna change everything about concept of free will either but
            anyways. I am not here to talk about religion and its concepts. The
            subject was "free will".
          </p>
          <h2>WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE FREE WILL?</h2>
          <p>
            We don't have infinite amount of choices in our lives. Neither we
            have knowledge of entire universe or infinite amount of brain power
            to compute all the different chocies. Therefore all of our choices
            are gonna be biased. Bias that has been created by outer world. Only
            way i can think of having a free will is to have infinite amount of
            knowledge to judge everything perfectly and make a truly unbiased
            choice and infinite amount of computing power to deal with all the
            information. And maybe endless time to make decisions. Long story
            short you must be a god to have any free will. Otherwise all of your
            decisions are gonna get limited by things you cannot control.
            Therefore it is impossible to have any free will. All of your
            thoughts are products of your brain processing all your knowledge.
            You have chosen neither of them. If you want to have a mind that is
            more "free" you need to feed it with more information to have
            conclusions that are less biased but it never becomes totally
            unbiased.
