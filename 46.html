        <article>
          <p>
            This one is hard for me. Didn't talk much about my father. I have a
            love-hate relationship with my dad. It is mostly hate but with
            certain level of understanding. He was absent in majority of my life
            because he is a soldier. Never had any serious conversation with my
            dad. Never shared a thought or emotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dad was an abusive asshole up until I hit the puberty. He was
            beating me on a regular basis. Sometimes for no reason. My mother
            was a total bitch as well. She once had beaten me so hard I got
            bruises all over my face and couldn't go to school for a few days.
            That was all because I refused to sleep one night. Mom and dad were
            fighting every single week. I had to stay in my room and listen to
            them tearing down the entire fucking house. My family is the only
            reason I am determined not to get married.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can talk about how much domestic violence I had to endure
            throughout my childhood and early teenage years but have no time for
            that. It would take pages and pages. All that crap has ended after I
            grew up. They couldn't hurt me physically anymore because I had a
            tendency of fighting back. I got some serious anger issues because
            of all this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up without a father figure. My father wasn't someone I
            aspired to be. People talk about how dangerous absence of a father
            figure can be. Your mind wonders way too freely without a father
            figure. This is why men came up with the ultimate father figure,
            god. Growing up without a father figure either makes you or breaks
            you. It gives you a sense of helplessness. You are totally alone in
            the world and there isn't any guidance you can look up to. You don't
            know what kind of life you should live, what kind of behavior you
            must have. Nobody can hold you up and show you the true way of life.
            You hold onto whatever you can. You aspire to be someone who is not
            your dad. You start looking for another father figure. You can end
            up in the wrong hands very easily. This is why people with daddy
            issues are the most impulsive people on earth. They do what exactly
            their fathers don't want them to do. They do things in spite.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there are some dangers of father figures. The fact that you are
            nothing but a shadow of your dad. You are nothing but a copycat. You
            cannot truly face with reality in presence of a father figure. You
            cannot come up with your own identity. You do what your father tells
            you and avoid being a man he doesn't want you to be. No parent truly
            want their kids to grow up. Especially control freaks. They don't
            want you to take risks and endanger your life. They don't want you
            to fly away. They want to keep you under control all the time.
            Father figure is the ultimate authority. In presence of a control
            freak, you cannot truly grow up. You end up being an extremely
            incapable human being.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there are idols, role models. People you look up to. People you
            aspire to be. Actors, stars, intellectuals, influencers, people with
            big names. They are fathers of the society. We want to look like
            them, we want to talk like them, we want to do things their way.
            Just like a little kid imitating his daddy. We take their words as
            gospel. We are living under their shadows and following their
            footsteps. They are holding the leash of the entire society. Most
            often than not they are pushing the world towards a high cliff. This
            is why we must kill our fathers if we want to truly grow up. You
            should not have any role model. There is a time when you must man
            the fuck up and think with your own brain. There is a time when you
            must make your own choices and come up with your own identity.
            People sure will stand against you. They will even say that you are
            immature. I don't know what is so mature about licking asses and
            being a conformist little boy eating up every single word comes out
            of his daddy's mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Living without a father figure can bring you down. But one thing is
            for sure, you will never grow up in the presence of fathers. A
            grownup is a person who does whatever the fuck he wants and faces up
            with the consequences all by himself, like a man. A grownup is a
            person with his own identity. Growing up is not turning into a
            grumpy ass old man with no joy. This is what immaturity is. Thinking
            that you grew up simply because you do "grownup things". This is
            what kids do when they first step into puberty. And some never leave
            puberty. Just like the ones living under the shadows of other men.

            I lost my great grandpa a few days ago. He was almost 100 years old.
            His death saddened me, even though we were not that close. He died
            in peace. At least this is a little comforting. He was a perfectly
            healthy man prior to his death. He was a true hard worker. Every
            single day he woke up early in the morning and worked in his garden.
            I have never seen him angry, never seen him hurting anyone. He
            didn't talk much either. He was always minding his business. He
            lived long enough to see the children of his grandchildren.
          </p>
          <p>
            He survived many things including a global pandemic and a motorcycle
            accident he had 5 years ago. Yeah, he was riding his bike not so
            long ago despite his old age. Great grandpa was from an era where
            weak children didn't make it. Many kids didn't even live long enough
            to hit the puberty back then. He has seen lots of famines and wars.
            He served in the army for more than 2 years. He survived them all
            but got defeated by the time itself. I guess the time is the biggest
            murderer. Time has no remorse, time has no pity. It comes fast and
            strikes hard. Time is undefeatable. Time is gonna eat us all.
          </p>
          <p>Rest in peace great grandpa. You will be missed.</p>
