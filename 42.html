        <h1>LIFE IS A PRIVILEGE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Breathing air, putting nutrients in your system, hydrating and
            dumping out organic waste. They call it living. Hah! Do you think
            you are living? Do you think that's what life is? Keeping your body
            functional until it isn't.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have seen people including myself showing signs of life but not
            actually living. Life is a privilege. Only lucky few on earth
            experiencing what the life is. You have never seen wonders of earth.
            Never flew across the ocean and skydived into an island. Never
            experienced true love. Never flew an airplane. Never ate all those
            exotic foods you cannot even pronounce. Never sailed on a boat for
            days to see where wind blows you. Never visited places you always
            wanted to visit. Never seen the north lights with naked eyes. Never
            had guts to jump into water from a high cliff. Never spent a couple
            days in a forest all by yourself just for the heck of it. Never flew
            in a wingsuit. Never attempted to climb on top of a large mountain.
            Never pushed your body to the limits. Never tried to master the art
            of mounted archery. Never learned martial arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are places on earth where sky never ends. Mountains so
            beautiful you cannot keep your eyes away. Air that is so oxygen rich
            and fresh it makes you realize it wasn't air you were breathing your
            entire life. Lakes that are so clear and reflective it almost looks
            like there are two skies in the horizon. Forests that are so
            beautiful and full of life it makes you think you can spend your
            entire life in there. Mountainous grasslands that are so green and
            beautiful you want to run across them until you run out of breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nature offers some beauties beyond imagination. They all seem so
            close yet so far away. You don't get a chance to see a glimpse of
            how they look with your own eyes. You only see them in pictures. You
            are stuck in your tiny little apartment surrounded by other ugly
            concrete buildings. All you breathe is coal and exhaust fumes and
            all you hear is some noisy shitters and asshole neighbors shouting
            their asses off all the time. Occasionally some gunfire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is all about experience but something was always holding you
            back to get that experience. Something wasn't letting you truly
            live. Maybe its you, maybe it is poverty, maybe it is the fact that
            you don't have enough balls to experience life or maybe you are just
            a wage slave. In any case, it is the privilege of life you are
            missing. You are too busy surviving, you don't get any chance to
            live. Big tragedy. Not the biggest because you are at least
            breathing. You can always be grateful for that. But it is killing
            you inside that there is an asshole out there living the life you
            always wish to live. Doing things you can only imagine to do. Going
            places you can only wish to go. Nailing chicks you can only dream
            of. Has your dream physique. Maybe you see that exact same asshole
            on instagram or youtube. And asking yourself "What the hell am I
            doing with my life?".

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 14 SEPTEMBER 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I have spent all day doing some chores. Cleaning my room, getting
            rid of some trash that was collecting dust in my drawers, got a new
            haircut. Also spent some time getting back on track. I am easing my
            way into massive amounts of ass pain. I will spend the entire month
            studying the art of computer wizardry. Didn't give up on my dreams
            of being a code monkey. It seems to be the only way of saving my ass
            after this point. Don't have much time, don't have much finance,
            don't have massive amounts of skills. I will settle for whatever
            entry level computer job exists. 5-6 months doesn't seem a lot of
            time but I hope it is enough to gain basic knowledge about web
            development. I think I will spend a solid week learning about
            internet stuff day and night. Oh god help me.
