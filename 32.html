            Depression is like a bottomless pit. You never know how worse it can
            get. Just when you think it already ripped all your soul away, you
            lose the last bits of energy you didn't even know you had. You were
            feeling like a trainwreck already, now you are a trainwreck on fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have literally descended into a cave troll in a couple weeks. Did
            not even see the sunlight for a long time. Avoiding all human
            interactions, locking myself up into my room, drowning myself in my
            lonliness and self hatred. It is so easy to do that while everything
            turns into a pile of shit nowadays. World is tearing itself apart,
            my country is in the verge of downfall, nothing is enjoyable, my
            health is deteriorating everyday...
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems I need a damn miracle. I don't feel like anything is gonna
            change after this point. My life is fucked beyond repair. This blog
            should have been ended 6 months ago and I should have been doing somewhat
            ok. But I fucked it up. As always. Time is a deceitful little
            bastard. I cannot believe I lost at least 6 years without even
            noticing. It was like yesterday. I am at where I was 6 years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next couple days I will be busy making a decision. Probably the most
            important one in my life.
