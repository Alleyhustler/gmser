        <h1>NO REAL PEOPLE LEFT ON THE INTERNET</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I shared a couple half-assed blog posts about the depressing state
            of the internet and even more depressing future of it. I think shit
            might go south even earlier than I thought. Living in a shithole of
            a country with a huge political mess makes you realize a lot of
            things. One of those things are how much of the internet is infested
            by bots, impostors, shills and NPC-like people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not even talking about those content farms in Southeast Asia.
            And I can guarantee you it is not only an Asian thing. For those who
            don't know, there are loads and loads of content on the internet,
            mostly on tiktok, generated by some million dollar companies for
            sake of viral marketing. There are literally fake celebrities pushed
            by these companies only to sell some products. Maybe you seen some
            of those people on Tiktok Matketplace selling a dress on live
            stream. There are offices where there are dozens of tiny studios for
            these streamers. There are loads of "e-girls", "e-boys" or whatever
            they are called on twitch, streaming some videogames and pushing
            products all day. It sure is depressing but not as depressing as the
            brainwashing methods of world governments on social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first started to notice hoards of shills and fake accounts on
            Social Media 10-12 years ago thanks to an Islamic Cult in Turkey.
            Maybe You heard the name Harun Yahya or Adnan Oktar. He has a few
            names. This guy was a total lunatic who claimed to be the messiah.
            He brainwashed some young people with rich families to join his cult
            and sexually assaulted so many young girls. He had some weird ass TV
            programs where bunch of heavily painted women with tons of plastic
            surgery gather in the same studio and agree with everything this fat
            fuck says. They even laugh at his cringy jokes. It was so surreal.
          </p>
          <p>
            His cult and his so called "Kittens" is a massive rabbit hole all by
            itself but what was really scummy about these people is how they
            sued everyone who opposed them and of course their massive social
            media presence. They had tons and tons of "bots" on the internet.
            Social media accounts controlled by a handful of people. They did
            things like spamming comments on YT, posting tweets with fake
            accounts, blackmailing people, doxxing people, sending death threats
            via e-mail and phone calls, causing people their jobs, they even
            invented the "swatting" method before it was even a thing. They had
            enough power and connections to frame people and send a police team
            to their houses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays this fat pig is rotting behind the bars but his scummy
            methods of controlling the social media is bigger than ever. Back
            when my country was under the influence of a certain cult leader who
            claimed to be a messiah (Talking about a different guy, I swear. We
            have many clowns who tried the same trick.) we had a massive surge
            of internet shills. Some of them were big names disguised as content
            creators on YT. They had a massive army of bot accounts and spread
            their propaganda non stop. Nowadays our government has its own team
            of "PsyOps specialists" or as we call them "paid trolls". Russia
            does the same shit, so does China and many other dictators,
            governments, cult leaders, politicians, maybe even some tech
            billionaires.
          </p>
          <p>
            You probably came across bunch of schizos online who claims that
            every thread on the internet, every post is a PsyOps. They really
            think that there are bunch of alphabet boys in suits, sitting in a
            dark room in Pentagon, lurking through an anime forum, dodging all
            the tranny porn and degenerate hentai art, just to start a few
            threads to brainwash bunch of terminally online autists into
            committing certain acts. If I say it this way, it sounds ridiculous,
            and it is to a certain degree. But if all the world governments and
            shady dictators have their own teams of paid trolls, why not Uncle
            Sam? Or CIA? The answer is, they do. They even train certain
            terrorist organizations on topics like cybersecurity. US Army has a
            PsyOps branch. So does the Ukrainian army and they use it very
            effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the question is, if all these different groups, all these
            companies, governments, terrorists, dictators, cult leaders pump out
            shitload of biased, fabricated, fake, bullshit content to the
            internet, can we even know for sure there are real people left on
            the internet? Surely people like you and me have tiny social media
            presence. I am not talking about that. I am talking about all those
            internet celebrities, accounts with millions of followers,
            subscribers, viewers or whatever. All those big names. How many of
            them are shills? How many of them get paid by rich sugar daddies to
            post certain content and change the consensus? How many of them are
            total bots?
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you, the dear reader is the only real person left on the
            internet? Is it lonely out there?

        <article>
          <p>
            Yesterday was one of the best days in my life. My girlfriend, me and
            a few other friends went on a trip. We walked all day, tried some
            new food, seen new places, watched a laser show, took tons of
            pictures together. After a long time I had a beutiful day like a
            normal person. This type of socialization is new to me. Last time I
            went outside with a group of people and had fun all day was when I
            was in high school.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to appreciate life a lot more. I feel like I was looking
            through shit stained glasses my entire life. If you wanna see
            everything like shit, you start to see everyting like shit. It feels
            good to wake up to a day and not believe that world will end in a
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Long story short, I am slowly becoming a normie. It feels good not
            to give a shit about politics or depressing world events. It feels
            good to have an empty mind. Overthinking slowly chews you up,
            shortens your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote this post long time ago when I was still pretty melancholic.
            Ironic thing is, the moment I stopped being miserable, my creativity
            for writing went out the window. I guess no wonder why so many great
            writers, artists and philosophers lived miserable lives. It is not a
            big deal though, I never had that much talent to begin with. Soon I
            will end this blog and keep it as a memoir. A part of me will keep
            persisting on the internet for decades if this blog doesn"t get
            terminated.
