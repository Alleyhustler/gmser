        <article>
          <p>
            As George Carlin once said "Time is a human invention, there are no
            numbers up in the sky, we made the whole thing up." Time is a
            concept that is just beyond hairless monkeys like us. We have no
            concept of time. Some of us were smart enough to understand time is
            just relative. The time between the beginning of the universe and he
            end of it is just a moment. Could be a second if you are an alien
            living in another universe. You cannot catch the time, there is no
            such thing as present. It just moves in different speed depending on
            where you are or what you are. And they also say space and time are
            the same, hence the term space-time continuum. Total mindfuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily though, you don't need to be Albert Einstein to understand
            we are not permanent. Average human life expectency is so pathetic.
            I have experienced how short the life is first hand. I could swear
            that it was just yesterday when I first started the college.
            Yesterday, I have seen an old friend of mine I met in the first year
            of college. He was a highschool student back then. Now he is in 3rd
            grade. It was that moment I realized how big I screwed. Last 4-5
            years of my life were just mere seconds. They all gone. Without me
            realizing, they slipped out of my hand. You never understand how
            fast the time goes on if you don't look back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am afraid of waking up as an old man one day. I even seen a
            nightmare like this. I am waking up from my sleep, looking at the
            mirror and I am an old man giving its last breath and it is too late
            for everything. I wasted my entire life. I am so afraid this is
            gonna happen one day and I will regret everything. Everyone knows
            that time is valuable but nobody acts like it. We live like we are
            immortal.

        <article>
          <p>
            God fucking damn. I just feel like a trainwreck today. After a long
            break I hit the gym. I swear I only worked out for half an hour and
            now all my joints are killing me. I don't have much to say today. I
            am still trying to quit smoking, still trying to go back to gym and
            lose weight, still trying to fix my life. I feel like I am circling
            around. One break and woosh, all your efforts are gone. Consistency
            is the key. If you are trying to achieve something you are pretty
            much swimming against a current, a flow. You need to keep swimming
            or you fall behind.
