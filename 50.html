        <h1>OVERPAID CLOWNS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Among all the clowns dirtying up our precious air, celebrities are
            the most irritating ones. I know it is a form of entertainment for
            some people to talk about all the clown acts done by celebrities of
            all sorts but I am sick of it. Be it an artist, an athlete, an actor
            or actress, an internet celebrity, almost every single one of them
            are so damn entitled. They are delusional to think that people care
            about everything they say. If you are a musician, all I care about
            is the music you make. If you won't sing, just shut the fuck up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, calm your tiddies. Everyone is allowed to say whatever the hell
            they want, I get it. It is not the celebrities themselves making the
            whole situation irritating to me. It is the people giving them more
            credit than they deserve. Why would you give a damn about opinions
            of an entertainer? And they all act like they have a fundamental
            role in the society. Like the world would end if an actor doesn't
            enlighten us about how important the human rights are.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite ones are the instagram models, tikthots or any kind of
            person making money on internet using their sexual appeal. There is
            nothing wrong with that. I don't care how people earn their lives.
            Hell, I would do the same if I would have some huge bazooms. But,
            who the hell pays attention to whatever they say about anything?
            Sorry lady, all I care about is your gigantic mommy milkers. You
            made yourself a career using your ass not your mouth. Well, unless
            you are a pornstar who is really good at blowjobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even pornstars jumped into whatever is trendy. Some got into music
            industry. Some transitioned into being twitch thots because it is a
            lot easier. Some even got into politics. It is damn hilarious. How
            about, shut the hell up and keep sucking more dicks? Because I don't
            care whatever comes out of your mouth, I am more interested in
            whatever goes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the retarded ass fans of the most worthless celebrities, people
            making these clowns famous, people paying attention to everything
            they say defends them by saying "BuT ThEy MaKe A LoT MoRe MoNeY ThAn
            YoU, StoP BeiNg JeLaOuS". That only makes things a lot more tragic
            isn't it? Who cares how much they worth in money. Napoleon's penis
            does worth millions of dollars. Doesn't mean that Napoleon's willy
            is highly successful. I would prefer Rasputin's schlong anyways. Is
            success all about money?
          </p>
          <p>
            I have came into a realization long time ago. Fame and whatever
            people deem success is all about luck. Being a famous musician
            doesn't make you a good musician. A famous actor is not always a
            good actor and there are countless examples of this. A famous writer
            is usually the one who wrote a book about opening up your chakras,
            projecting positive energy to the universe, how to become a
            millionaire or some stupid shit like that. Majority of celebrities
            are bunch of overpaid clowns wasting the earth's resources.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 30 OCTOBER 2023</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I wrote this post a long time ago and it has nothing to do with
            current events. I don't even remember which celebrity and their
            idiotic behavior made me write this abomination. I was planning to
            delete this thing but I am getting short on topics to talk about. I
            apologize for the poor content but after all I really did not
            promise anything worth reading. I won't be able to update my blog
            very often in the upcoming months. So nothing will be different, I
            guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been talking to a girl lately. I get this weird sensation I
            never felt before. It is really hard to put in words. I feel warmth
            on my chest whenever I talk to her. Have you ever looked at
            something so beautiful that you almost felt like you are getting
            hypnotized? This is the feeling I get whenever I look at her. I
            cannot keep my eyes away. I am not sure what the hell is going on
            with me but for the last couple days I could not think about
            anything but her. It just sucks that she lives thousands of miles
            away from me.
