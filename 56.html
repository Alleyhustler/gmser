        <h1>LONELINESS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Why we love watching people destroy their lives? Is it because of a
            sadistic primal instinct makes it irrationally addicting? Why we all
            love watching a gambling addict betting and losing all their money
            and tearing down their entire houses as a consequence? Why we all
            love to turn miserable nutjobs into lolcows? Why we love trolling,
            stalking, mobbing people to the edge of suicide? What makes it so
            addicting to watch people like Chris Chan, Niko Avocado, that fatass
            youtuber who is addicted to hookers humiliate themselves in front of
            millions? Why we love that kind of shit?
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all of us enjoy that, sure but maybe you did at some point in
            your life. Maybe you were that pathetic internet troll unleashing
            all your hatred onto unsuspecting people. Yes you were. As I was. We
            love seeing people suffer on the internet, we love seeing a low life
            loser doing a lot worse than us. Because we are miserable, we are
            lonely, we are insecure. We need to pull people down to feel better
            about ourselves. If you are not happy with your life, nobody else
            should feel happy about their lives either. We need do see somebody
            else who is more pathetic than us just to feel a little less
            miserable. We need to hold onto whatever delusional ideas we possess
            to feel special.
          </p>
          <p>
            No dumbass! Nobody gives a crap about your radical bullshit. Or your
            obscure sense of humor you try to make people believe it is just
            harmless dark humor. Or your edgy
            red,black,blue,purple,orange-pilled ultra-based ideology. Or your
            cringy edgelord tier shitposting. You are just a miserable NEET cunt
            who has no friends. You need to hide behind all this crap just to
            make yourself believe you are not one of those normies. Those
            normies, they can have all the fun, all the joy, all the pussy, all
            the money. You have wisdom. Wisdom that comes in the form of
            brainrot. Being terminally online is not a coping mechanism, not an
            addiction, it is a personality trait. It is what makes you unique.
            That's your whole persona. You might be a useless basement dweller
            who failed at everything, but you can at least flex on those stupid
            normies because they don't have IQ of 130. You must keep distracting
            yourself with thoughts like this. Just to veil the truth that you
            are a total failure. And if you pull yourself out of this situation,
            you will realize how stupid you were.

        <article>
          <p>
            Hello everyone, it is me again. For the last few weeks I was
            travelling a lot. I should really stop ignoring this blog. This is
            the only place where I can truly be myself. I pour all my
            personality, all my soul into this. This is the beauty of having a
            personal blog. There aren't many communities left online where you
            can share all your thoughts without the fear of getting cancelled. I
            said so many terrible things here, regretfully. But everyone needs
            to decharge in a way. This blog is my escape. I also shared my
            deepest, darkest secrets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In real life I am very reclusive. I am very reluctant to share
            things about myself. But here I am sharing every thought, stupid or
            not, with possibly hundreds of people. I love this platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last 1.5 months I was having some problems with weed. I
            never smoked weed before I moved here. I am very instinctive by
            nature. When my brain tells me to do something, my body obeys the
            command. And just like that I got hooked into devil's lettuce. At
            first it was exciting. Every food tasted better, every color seemed
            different, music sounded orgasmic. And it gave me loads of
            creativity. I could draw everything in my head with perfect
            precision. But after wasting several weeks getting high as fuck,
            having several bad trips and risking my mental health, it is time to
            stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also got into meditation. I always believed it is just a stupid
            semi-sipiritualistic white collar hobby. You cannot find a single
            silicon valley billionare who doesn't start his day maditating for
            30 minutes it seems. But after a quick research I learned that
            meditation comes in a million different forms and mindfullness
            exercises can actually help with my mental condition. I will try to
            make it a day to day habit. I believe 2025 will be my year, finally.
