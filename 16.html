        <h1>NO POLITICAL IDEOLOGY IS GONNA SAVE THE WORLD</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Politics always been a mess and I never had strong opinions on
            politics. Because every single politic view is faulty. Why? Because
            of the people. Everyone believes their political ideology is the key
            and it is gonna solve every single problem. I don't buy that.
            Because same type of people are gonna be ruling the world. Does it
            matter if your country is being ruled by monarchy or democracy if
            the ruler is the same guy? Does it even matter you have democracy if
            only certain people can be elected? People doesn't want liberalism,
            communism, monarchy, theocracy. They want perfection. They want
            everything to work as they wish. This is never gonna happen because
            of the human factor. We are far from perfect.
          </p>

            Communism and capitalism is almost equally bad as an economical
            model. One can be preferred to other but none of them is good for
            nature. It is hilarious some people think communism is even gonna
            save the nature because capitalism is the only reason we destroy it.
            I call this bullshit. Sure, luxury and consumerism gives one hell of
            a damage to the earth. But communist countries gave same amount of
            damage if not more thanks to getting into dick measuring contest
            with capitalist countries. And it is in the human nature. In both
            capitalism and communism the goal is to obtain all natural
            resources, abuse the hell out of the world and spread our genes as
            far as we can. I have not strog opinions on politics i said but i
            can make an exception for communism. I am highly against communism.
            I don't know you but I would never want to be a slave of government.
            Communism is the most authoritarian and totalitarian regime one can
            imagine. Sure you are gonna end up being a wageslave in free economy
            but communism doesn't solve the problem. You are gonna suck
            someone's dick no matter what. Government owns literally everything.
            Who wouldn't abuse such power? Sure it can work in the hands of
            right people, but if shit goes wrong, it goes wrong really wrong.
            Imagine bunch of idiots wasting your entire life's effort by
            building nukes, rockets, guns just to show off. This happened with
            the soviets. I see people complaining about taxes, how about
            government stealing all your life's effort? You have an awesome
            project that can literally save lives? Good luck convincing boomers
            in government to fund it, they will be busy increasing the budget of
            the army. Communism doesn't solve the problem of inequality either,
            we born unequal. Bunch of cannibals on higher places always gonna be
            having the most resources. In communism, entire resources. It is a
            double edged sword. And since government owns the entire media you
            will see nothing but propaganda on TV. You are sick of your
            president, prime minister or whoever rules your country? Imagine
            that guy ruling your country with communism. Imagine a communist
            america where Trump, George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan is the
            president. I am not giving these names beacuse i hate these guys
            with passion. I am not familiar with american politics that much. I
            gave these names because I see they are one of the most hated
            presidents. Working class won't end with communism either, they
            won't have better lives with communism. Sure being a wageslave is
            horrible but so is the gulag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enough with communism, let's talk about what is wrong with
            capitalism. It is also a double edged sword because if economy is
            too free you see monopolies. There is no escape from things like
            that in free economy. Governments are trying to regulate the free
            market to avoid this but if they get corrupted by the free market
            who is gonna save you from those giant monopolies? I said you need
            to convince boomers in government to get funded in order to achieve
            big things in communism. In capitalism nobody gives a shit about how
            useful your project is. They only care about how profitable it is.
            And intellectual property rights is the reason why we can never have
            nice things. You are so proud of your work and thinking you are
            doing a good job by inventing something totally new? Well good luck
            dealing with patent trolls. And enjoy all your work is getting
            stolen because a total genius patented the straight lines you used
            in your project. There are stupid cases like this, specially in
            America. There is even a patent for rounded square. And let's not
            forget about the consumerism. The key is to happiness is to consume
            for many people. Buying shit you will never use and throw away.
            Companies getting into your mind with their brand new polished turd.
            You think you cannot live without it. You cannot own things in
            communism but can you really own things in today's world? You cannot
            even fix your own shit because it only can be fixed by the company
            because of the fancy software. People usually doesn't pay for things
            nowadays, they pay for the services. Amazon can erase your favorite
            book from your kindle because you don't actually own it at all.
            Netflix can cancel your favorite movie, apple can nuke your iphone
            with the brand new software update. All the shit you buy spies on
            you or can be unusable in a couple years thanks to its brilliant
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any type of regime you get fucked. With communism you get fucked
            by the government, with capitalist regimes you get fucked by
            monopolies, with monarchy monarch fucks you all by himself, with
            theocracy you get fucked in the name of god... None of the political
            ideologies solves the problem. Problem is the human, we are bunch of
            greedy assholes. We cannot handle the power, we discriminate, we
            hate, we kill, we make no sense, we don't like to use our brains.

        <article>
          <p>
            Yesterday i was gonna share another update but I fell asleep and
            woke up in the middle of the day. I guess I won't be sleeping today.
            Today's topic might be controversial but shouldn't be. I am just an
            idiot trying to understand things. As I said before I am not deep
            into politics because I think it is all bullshit. And my stuff
            doesn't worth arguing. I am just dumping whatever I think here in
            this dark corner of internet. I hope you have a good day.
