        <h1>TOO MANY FEELINGS VERY FEW WORDS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Have you ever realized how we don't have words for every kind of
            feeling? Maybe my vocabulary is trash but everybody at some point
            tried to explain something but has been defeated by boundaries of
            language.
          </p>
          <p>How many different feelings can you describe?</p>
          <p>
            Love, hate, happiness, anger, joy, sadnessâ€¦ Maybe you can go a
            little further with fancier words like euphoria or epiphany.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever since I learned about untranslatable words from different
            languages it started to boggle my mind that how many different
            feelings are there that is hard to describe. Did you know about that
            German word called "Waldeinsamkeit"? It has no direct translation
            but it roughly means feeling lonely in the woods. And there is a
            word called "Aspaldiko" in Basque language roughly means happiness
            you feel after meeting someone you haven't seen for a long time.
            "Fernweh" means homesickness for a a place you have never been
            before in German. "Abbiocco" in Italian means the drowsiness you
            feel after a large meal. "Koi no yokan" in Japanse describes the
            excitement you feel after meeting with someone you think you will
            love eventually
          </p>
          <p>
            Lots of unique words from lots of different languages describing
            feelings you have felt before but couldn't put in words. But how
            about many other feelings nobody can describe, even ones only you
            can understand personally and maybe never felt by someone else
            before.
          </p>
          <p>
            How about being in a long car trip during the night and listening to
            radio while watching out the window?
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, sitting on a bench enjoying the clear skies in an afternoon
            during the summer?
          </p>
          <p>
            How about staying in your room with a cup of coffee and watching the
            raindrops slowly crawling down your window?
          </p>
          <p>
            Waking up in the middle of a night and not knowing what to do and
            just sitting there in the darkness feeling numb.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at old black and white photos of random people and thinking
            about all those people lived on earth and left without leaving a
            mark.
          </p>
          <p>Coming across a random youtube video from 2006 with 100 views.</p>
          <p>Visiting the places you have been in as a kid long time ago.</p>
          <p>
            There must be a word for last hours of school on Friday. It's been a
            long time since I felt this. Last class and last minutes of school
            and you have all weekend for yourself to enjoy. It is just a lot
            more than happiness. It sure is a feeling on its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about your old friends and wondering what they do. This
            sure is a weird kind of feeling specially if you had lots of friends
            in the past and have no friends now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being outside and hearing no voices or seeing no human being. Just
            empty streets and chirps of birds. Wondering where is everyone for a
            couple minutes until you actually see someone.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing places that are vaguely familiar but also strange.</p>
          <p>
            Looking at the sky and thinking about all those planets you won't
            even get a chance to see in your lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satisfaction of looking at something beautiful you have created with
            your own hands. Possibly the best kind of feeling but we don't have
            a specific word for it. What a shame.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe I am just weird or overly emotional. I get goosebumps from
            certain kind of music or looking at a painting, photograph or a
            drawing giving me weird vibes. I am sure I am not the only one
            having a hard time describing weird vibes like these. Some of those
            feelings are so obscure it is impossible to even understand what
            exactly triggers them.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - JULY 6 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I feel like a total trainwreck. I was working up until 7 p.m. Did
            not even get a chance to rest. And all for what? I am earning 100 US
            freedom bucks equivalent of money per month. And I do all sorts of
            heavy work. I am getting double penetrated in the ass. My boss is
            one asshole looks exactly like Trevor from GTA 5. Resemblance is
            uncanny. He is one stingy cunt who is paying me less than half of
            the minimum wage and asking me to do all sorts of work. He is
            probably testing how tight is my anus. I won't work more than a
            month in this shithole of a workplace. I do this all because my
            asshole dad wants me to do this. It is retarded to do this job even
            in this state of economy.
