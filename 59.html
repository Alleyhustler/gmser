        <h1>SIMULACRA AND SIMULATION</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I know it gets boring, but thinking of Matrix made me realize
            something. I came across an interview with Jean Baudrillard. He was
            trashing the whole movie and saying that his philosophy been
            bastardized by it. Then I dived balls into postmodernism, simulacra,
            hyper-reality and all that stuff.
          </p>
<p>
    I know it gets boring, but staring at candlestick charts made me realize something. I came across a tweet thread about Baudrillard and memecoins. Some anon was trashing the whole "number go up" mentality, saying crypto bastardized his philosophy. Then I aped balls-deep into researching simulation theory between sniping new meme launches.
</p>

<p>
    I still don't know much about postmodern philosophy to be honest. As far as I can tell, crypto is the ultimate simulation. A hyperreal casino where the tokens represent nothing but the collective hopium of degens. In the pre-DeFi ages, money was at least tied to physical stuff - gold, labor, whatever. Then we created fiat, a simulation of value. Now with memecoins, we've built a simulation on top of that simulation. Hence we got "degentopia". Crypto made us lose all contact with real value. All the charts and metrics lost their ties to anything tangible. The more shitcoins we create, the more we trade, the further we stray from any fundamental reality. From what I understand, crypto postmodernism is all about "Value is whatever the mob decides. There is no absolute floor."
</p>

<p>
    Aside from all the philosophical cope, the anon had a point. Maybe I'm regarded, whatever... But there will be a time when we won't be able to tell what's a real project and what's a honeypot. The alpha will get lost in all the noise, like a new memecoin in a sea of copycats.
</p>

<p>
    Here's the ironic thing about crypto intellectuals. They talk about decentralization and transparency yet explain their projects in the most unintelligible jargon possible. I get it ser, you have to maintain that "10x brain" reputation, but it's hilarious when your whitepaper reads like the very financial systems you're trying to replace. But I guess they can be excused because they're probably French (or pretending to be).
</p>

<p>
    So yes, it's ironic that the biggest "thought leaders" are just typical shillers. That's the deal with many crypto "philosophers". You can call me a low-IQ degen but truth is truth - so-called "alpha groups" 99% of the time overcomplicate everything. Did you know that some of the biggest rugpullers wrote Medium articles that got published on "reputable" crypto news sites? Whole documents full of word salad about "disruptive liquidity solutions" and "paradigm-shifting tokenomics" that meant absolutely nothing. Maybe you remember the Bitconnect whitepaper. Magnificent blockchain-level shitposting.
</p>

<h2>THE CRYPTO SIMULATION</h2>

<p>
    That anon was wrong about memecoins though - they're the purest expression of hyperreality. He was too proud to admit that dog-themed shitcoins perfectly embody his ideology. He probably hated all forms of speculation. He'd say memecoins miss the point because there's a clear difference between "real projects" and "shitcoins". However, any degen knows that even "real projects" only exist as part of the casino. You need that illusion of fundamentals to maintain the hopium. There have been many more "ETH killers" and many more "next Bitcoin" narratives. The system creates its own serious projects to distract from the fact it's all gambling.
</p>

<p>
    And this little detail makes all the difference. Crypto exists in its own timezone - it could be 2017 or 2021 or 2077, who knows? The financial systems it's built upon are so far detached from traditional markets they're unrecognizable. A market based on pure speculation, a hyper-economy. A reality where no pieces of intrinsic value remain. Everything is priced based on narratives and memes. Just bits and pieces of information manipulated by whales. Imagine we lost all financial history and relied purely on Crypto Twitter threads to learn about value. Welcome to the desert of the real.
</p>

<p>Just like the degen said in the Telegram group:</p>

<p>
    "Do you know what this reminds me of? Real yield. Did you ever farm real yield?"
</p>

<p>"No, but technically, neither did you."</p>

<p>
    "That's exactly my point. Exactly. Because you have to wonder: how do protocols know what 'real yield' looks like? Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe what I think is yield farming actually tastes like a Ponzi, or a rugpull. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take stablecoins, for example: maybe they couldn't figure out how to make them stable, which is why they're pegged to everything."
</p>

<p>
    So in that case "APY" is a piece of code detached from its origin to the point it lost all ties with reality. A yield not based on production. A chart without assets. A pure shitcoin.
</p>

<p>
    Here's the irony of the bull and bear pills. The choice makes no difference. You take the bull pill and keep farming imaginary yields in DeFi heaven. You take the bear pill and join the "DYOR" crowd that's also trapped in the simulation by giving them fake alpha. No matter what you choose, you're playing the same game.
</p>

<p>
    Back in my early degen days, I thought 2017 was the wild west of crypto. Now I realize every cycle is the same. Ask about 2017 to a guy who got rekt in the ICO boom or held bags through 2018 and he'll tell you how different it really was. Or ask about 2021 to the ape who YOLO'd into Squid Game token.
</p>

<p>
    I started trading sometime in the last bull run. I have very little memory of what actual investing looks like. I made all my judgments based on Crypto Twitter, influencer threads and second-hand war stories from other degens. And how could I so confidently talk about market cycles? Due to second-hand narratives, a second-hand image of finance I absorbed. You see where this is going?
