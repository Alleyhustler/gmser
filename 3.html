        <h1>NOTHING REMAINS ON THE INTERNET</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I love surfing on the web. Internet is an amazing, awful,
            disgusting, entertaining, upsetting, cheerful, cancerous and
            sometimes horrifying place. Arguably the best invention after the
            invention of writing. But everything on internet is quite temporary.
            Even the term "surfing" became something obsolete. If "surfing" the
            web is one of your hobbies people might even think that you are some
            sort of weirdo nowadays. Because internet only consists of youtube,
            twitter, facebook, instagram, netflix for most people. If you are a
            weirdo you can also add 4chan and reddit into the list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Big tech definitely ruined the entire internet. In every
            single social media platform big brother allows certain type of
            opinions and cancel rest of them. Do not take the term "big brother"
            so literally. I am not a tinfoil hat guy, i know world is not being
            ruled by a single entity. Even if the content is not political or
            "offensive" they can get nuked for several reasons. Sometimes DMCA
            decides to fuck with content creators. As a result we are losing
            bits and pieces of internet day by day. And old content is getting
            replaced by more bullshit. Tons of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well of course tech companies are allowed to do whatever they want
            with their platform, this is not the concern. But most of the time
            governments are also censoring the huge portion of the internet. In
            China you cannot talk shit about president Pooh. In Russia you
            cannot talk shit about the obvious guy. In North Korea you don't
            even have access to the internet, they have their own network and
            you better praise the supreme leader everyday on North Korean
            twitter. In United States of Freedom, you are totally free to say
            whatever you want but they are gonna keep their eyes on you. One day
            you might end up seeing a glowing guy in your backyard. All of the
            world governments are aware of the power internet has to offer. USA
            even has an internet killswitch (Standard Operating Procedure 303).
            They have seen how easily people can get organsied on the internet
            during Arab Spring. They can cut all the communication anytime they
            want in a certain area of the USA. Considering majortiy of internet
            traffic is based on America they also have power to control internet
            traffic of the world. And shit is getting even worse.
          </p>
          <h2>BERLIN WALL OF THE INTERNET (MORE LIKE GREAT WALL OF CHINA)</h2>
          <p>
            It seems that there is a good chance internet is gonna split apart
            into pieces. Some countries in the world are gonna have their own
            intranet networks. These are not my predictions of course. In 2018
            former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt has predicted that internet is
            gonna split in two by 2028. And he has some sensible arguments. He
            claims that China wants to play alone and wants to create their own
            "internet". Considering that China developing its own internet
            protocol it is not so far from reality. In China you are not allowed
            to access great portion of the internet anyways. They might as well
            pull the plug of the internet and build a huge wall between China
            and rest of the world. And most terrifying thing is, there is a
            great chance Russia and some other countries might join them and we
            might end up having two gigantic networks that cannot communicate to
            each other. This might change everything. It means that some
            countries are gonna be able to do their propaganda a lot easier. And
            it is also gonna be a lot easier for media to spew lies about other
            half of the world. No more fact checking. This might even totally
            destroy globalism and might result as two seperate societies that
            are totally alien to each other. This is a total win for all
            governments.
          </p>
          <p>
            But something even worse can happen. We might end up having more
            than two seperate "internets". Iran is currently working on their
            own intranet project. And it seems they are determined to cut all
            the communication with outer world. I feel so sorry for Iranian
            people. They probably have the worst possible government in the
            world other than maybe North Korea. I hope i won't get blacklisted
            by Iranian CIA after saying this. Iran has a lot of secular people
            despite all the brainwashing of their government.
          </p>
          <h2>MY WEIRD HOBBY - DATA HOARDING</h2>
          <p>
            I know i am not the only one concerned about future of the internet
            and preserving the internet history. I have seen a lot of people
            hoarding crapload of data to save the internet. I have seen people
            who has home servers with more than 1 Petabyte of storage. Some
            people give tremendous amount of effort to preserve the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, i was able to make myself a small collection of data as well.
            Nothing more than 800Gb. I save most of the stuff i find
            interesting. I was able to save some great websites over the years.
            Some of those websites doesn't exist on the web anymore. I also have
            some decent amount of books and documents. When it comes to books i
            am pretty picky. Reading a book requires a lot of time investment
            and i don't want to waste that time for reading something that is
            total dogshit. I also plan to save some stuff from youtube as soon
            as i get myself more storage. Some of my youtube playlists are half
            empty. I regret not saving all the stuff i like. Do not make the
            same mistake. Save your favorite youtube videos into your hard drive
            before they get nuked from existence.
