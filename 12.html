            "There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but
            the best ships are friendships, may they always be!" <br /><br />

            I started this post with a cheesy title maybe but I am far from
            being sarcastic. I mentioned i had no friends but this is wrong. My
            best and only friend lives miles away from me but i can never say he
            is not my true friend. I met with him about 1.5 years ago. He lives
            in United States. I found him in a crappy discord server full of
            toxic people but he was an exception. I got banned from that server
            but i kept the contact with that one guy. I could never imagine he
            being my best friend. And best person i have ever met. He is almost
            too good for this filthy world. He is very kind and sometimes pretty
            naive. He is pretty intelligent and a true hardworker. Me in the
            other hand is a lazy fuck with no talent. I sometimes feel like i
            don't deserve his friendship. I know many people but i cannot call
            any of them my friend. He is my one and only friend. He is the only
            one I can speak with without acting like someone I am not. He is a
            very good writer and soon enough he will become a pilot. He is not
            arrogant even a tiny bit. He is down to earth. His biggest dream is
            to live a life without being a burden on society and nature. He is
            really into agriculture and self sufficient life. He is truly one of
            a kind. It is really hard to find a non pretentious person let alone
            finding that kind of person on internet. I don't know what would i
            do without him.

            I was one of those people. Dreaming about living all alone. Thinking
            i don't need any friends. Thinking I can be my best friend. Thinking
            people are nothing but cancer. Yeah i was a total fucking edgelord
            when i was a teenager. After spending years without leaving my room
            i realized i don't like myself at all. I am my worst enemy.
            Lonliness is not my thing at all. I realized i am not truly an
            introvert. Realized i cannot live without expressing myself. I
            cannot live without human interaction. Lonliness plays some dirty
            tricks on you. You first start talking with yourself, then you start
            daydreaming and maybe you get an imaginary friend one day and all of
            a sudden you become a schizo. I would shoot myself in the head the
            day i become the last man on earth. Funny how I used dream about
            this. A world with nobody but me. Robinson Crusoe was my favorite
            book. I read that for 3 times at least. I always wanted to be a real
            life Robinson. I even wanted to buy a private island in the middle
            of nowhere just to live far away from any person. My 16yo stupid ass
            did not think about how am i suppose to survive all by myself. Your
            life expectancy suddenly turns into 40 instead of 70. Not to mention
            you need to work your ass off just to see another day. And you are
            gonna end up looking like a total fucking animal in no time if you
            are living in wilderness.

            You need other people for many things. Like it or not. You need
            friends in your life. You need other people's help in many things.
            Even if you are some sort of god who can live without anybody else
            you just don't need to. Why choose the hard way while people can
            help you? Why be a total dick and hurt people instead of making
            friends? Humans are the most social animals in the world. We did not
            survive because we are the strongest predators. We did not survive
            because we have sharp claws or 3 inch long teeth. We did not even
            survive due to our "superior" intelligence. We survived because we
            figured out how to stay together. We figured out how to create
            culture, how to create civilizations. Humans are below mediocre
            animals when it comes to physical abilities. Even in intelligence we
            are not so special. They say dolphins are almost as smart, i am not
            so sure about that but doesn't matter. Thing that makes us special
            is our social skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't be an idiot like me frens. Don't think you don't need any
            friends. And don't think you are just limited with your environment.
            You can always find like minded people. You just need to look
            harder.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 15 AUGUST 2021</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I wrote down all of my long term and short term goals in a text file
            today. And i gave them a specific time frame. I am currently reading
            a book about how to focus. When it comes to self improvement books
            90% of them are bullshit. But this one is both short and doesn't
            have any claims of being magical. The book is titled as Laser-Sharp
            Focus and written by Joanna Jast. I desperately need to fix my
            attention span. I might have ADHD. I cannot focus more than 10
            minutes. I heard this is pretty common. I cannot get my hands on
            medication. Neither i want to depend on them. I am planning to
            finish this book in a couple days. Setting some sub-goals was
            already helpful for getting some motivation. I am planning to finish
            15 small and simple projects made with basic HTML and CSS before
            August ends.
