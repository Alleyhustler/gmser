        <h1>CHALLENGE IDEAS FOR ZOOMERS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I am a little bit late to talk about tide pod challenge, cinnamon
            challenge and some other stupid shit like that. But everyday you see
            some brand new zoomer cringe. I am not hateful towards zoomers, i am
            barely a zoomer myself. I guess I can be considered as a late
            millenial. I just want to help my zoomer brothers to gain more fame.
            Stop doing what others do. Be creative bros. Here i have some ideas
            for you to try.
          </p>
          <h2>HYDROCLORIC ACID DRINKING CHALLENGE</h2>
          <p>Difficulty: 4/10</p>
          <p>Potential clicks: 8/10</p>
          <p>
            Eating tide pod, scooping lethal doses of pre workout, drinking
            bleach, eating cinnamon these are all old fashioned. If you want to
            stand out you must do the unthinkable. You must do the thing nobody
            ever dared before. In this challenge you drink at least 500 mL of
            hydrocloric acid. How do you find the acid is up to you, I am just
            here to advice.
          </p>
          <h2>SWIMMING ON LAVA CHALLENGE(POMPEII CHALLENGE)</h2>
          <p>Difficulty: 8/10</p>
          <p>Potential clicks: 9/10</p>
          <p>
            Pretty self explanatory, you just find a lava pool or better an
            active volcano and jump right in. I know what you are gonna ask,
            "But what if my hair gets messy?". Just wear a tinfoil hat you
            idiot. This way it is gonna both protect your hair and you are gonna
            have maximum resistance against fire.
          </p>
          <h2>OPENING UP AN LGBT FLAG IN AFGHANISTAN</h2>
          <p>Difficulty: 6/10</p>
          <p>Potential clicks: 10/10</p>
          <p>
            This one is pretty easy, only problem is to going into Afghanistan.
            Absolutely zero risk here. This is not only gonna educate afghans
            about LGBT rights but also gonna give you millions of clicks. This
            challenge can make you the most famous tiktoker in the world. And
            people are gonna remember you as a legend.
          </p>
          <h2>EATING STREET FOOD IN CHINA</h2>
          <p>Difficulty: 3/10</p>
          <p>Potential clicks: 9/10</p>
          <p>
            In this challenge you need to pay a visit to china. Not any place in
            china, you must choose small towns mostly. And you are gonna try
            every single street food for about a month. From eggs boiled in piss
            to infamous bat soup created the corona pandemic. If you don't die
            you are gonna be the most famous gourmet in the world.
          </p>
          <h2>OLYMPIC FLAME CHALLENGE</h2>
          <p>Difficulty: 8/10</p>
          <p>Potential clicks: 10/10</p>
          <p>
            Ok, you probably did not understand anything from the title but let
            me explain. In this challenge you must wait until the olympics and
            specifically for the olympic decathlon. Then you need to find a way
            to smuggle a can of gasoline into olympics. And you set yourself on
            fire after the starting shot and jump onto the track. If you win the
            race you are gonna be remembered as the first olympic flame ever won
            gold medal.
          </p>
          <h2>LIVING IN NORTH KOREA</h2>
          <p>Difficulty: 10/10</p>
          <p>Potential clicks: 0/10 (no itnernet in north korea)</p>
          <p>
            Very hard challenge yet not so rewarding. I don't recommend this
            challenge unless you are a north korean.
          </p>
          <h2>SOME FAMOUS CHALLENGES FROM THE INTERNET</h2>
          <p>
            I know I said you should be original but I guess I need to mention a
            couple legendary challenges that have been done before and went
            viral. I am not saying you shoud try these but they might inspire
            you in some ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            One guy one jar challenge: Coming from the infamous video "one guy
            one jar". In this challenge you need to push the limits of your anus
            with a glass jar and be sure it breaks inside you. This way you are
            gonna triple your fame.
          </p>
          <p>
            2 guys 1 horse challenge: Popularized by the video with the same
            title. Good thing about this challenge is you don't need two guys.
            Only thing you need is a horse. Very easy challenge. Recommended for
            beginners.
          </p>
          <p>
            1 guy 1 screwdriver challenge: Another legendary challenge. But not
            a super original idea. A similar challenge has been done in the
            video called "2 kids 1 sandbox". Since it is overdone, i do not
            recommend trying to replicate this challenge unless you have a
            really original idea. Something like using an ice pick or a knife
            instead of a screwdriver.

        <article>
          <p>
            I know I did not share anything yesterday. This stupid hard drive
            failed on me twice and I needed to start all over. Today I was busy
            switching into my other pc. I think it is time to retire my older
            pc. I was installing stuff I need and copying my files into this pc.
            For the first time I am using this pc to write something long. This
            keyboard is the worst thing in the world.
