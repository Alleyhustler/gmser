        <h1>FUTURE IS HERE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I am nowhere near being a fortune teller nor I am a futurist. But
            from things I have read and heard i can see where the future is
            going. Today I want to talk about stuff you most likely heard or can
            already see yourselves. I am gonna talk about what is probably gonna
            be waiting for us in the future.
          </p>
          <h2>INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 4.0</h2>
          <p>
            Let's start with the most obvious one. You must be living under a
            rock if you never heard industry 4.0. It is the new industrial
            revolution waiting for us. This revolution includes all sorts of
            things you heard countless times before and very familiar with. From
            Internet of Things to Augmanted reality. And unavoidble jump of AI
            technologies. Automatization never been this prominent before.
            Specially after the pandemic we gained 10 years worth of momentum in
            automatization. What that means is, machines are gonna fuck all of
            us up sooner than we thought. I am not talking about Skynet type of
            robocalypse. They are gonna take our jobs and nobody is safe. This
            time is so different than first industrial revolution. This time
            technology doesn't create as much job opportunities as it destroys.
            Fuck those who say "EvErYtHiNg Is GoNnA Be AlRiGht TeChNoLoGy AlWaYs
            CrEaTeS NeW JoBs". If a piece of algorithm makes 1 million people
            unemployed, you don't need 1 million people to create such
            algorithm. A few people can build a piece of software to turn up
            millions of people homeless. Even if we say all population can end
            up being knowledge workers, nobody can guarantee we will ever need
            that many knowledge workers. From things I know there is no need for
            billions of people in IT industry. And there is this problem that
            not everyone is passionate about learning. We will see a lot of
            homeless people on streets. And there is also that argument, if
            there is no consumer there is no money. If unemployment rates goes
            up, nobody can sell their stuff. It is correct that many people are
            gonna lose their revenue due to sharp increase in unemployment
            rates, but top 20% consumes 80% of resources anyways. Top rich
            people are always gonna be able to find a market for their stuff.
            Universal basic income won't solve the problem either. But at least
            it can avoid people being homeless or starving. What you think is
            gonna happen if majority of population lives substandard lives? I
            leave it to your imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of industry 4.0 some countries are not gonna make it.
            There is not gonna be any 2nd world country. There is gonna be day
            and night difference between different civilizations. Some are gonna
            rule the world with technological supremacy, others are gonna turn
            back to dark ages. There is only gonna be 1st world countries and
            3rd world countries.
          </p>
          <h2>SECOND COLD WAR</h2>
          <p>
            Another thing you probably know better than me. I am semi apolitic
            but even I know there is some fuckery going on between America and
            China. China invests in many 3rd world and second world countries,
            soon they are gonna conquer all trade routes. China already is the
            new biggest superpower of the world and America is not happy with
            that. I already mentioned how China plans to build their own
            national network and wants to totally ban the internet in their
            country and also mentioned other eastern block countries might do
            the same thing. A global war is a stupid idea, nobody can earn
            anything from it. Everyone loses. I don't see a global war coming
            but again the entire world is being ruled by bunch of bloodthirsty
            idiots. You can never know. Before the first world war, world was in
            the same situation. Nobody could see it coming. Entire Europe was
            having their best times. A war would only fuck everything up for
            everyone. Yet we saw two of the greatest wars in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade wars is already a thing and I see many countries growing their
            armies. Governments are sharpening their teeth. But again, politics
            was always so full of shit. This is not something new. With first
            world war we have seen the concept of entire nations turning into
            armies. We have seen how entire manpower of nations can grind each
            other down to zero. At the end of second world war we have seen the
            destructive power of nuclears. With the cold war we have seen the
            power of ballistic missiles and rockets. We now know we have enough
            power to truly wipe ourselves out from this planet. 3rd world war
            would be a suicide. Therefore i think it is not likely. But if this
            political dick measuring contest goes on, we won't have easy times.
          </p>
          <h2>CONFLICT HAS ENTERED THE CHAT</h2>
          <p>
            I probably mentioned how easy it is to control masses nowadays. In
            the future more conflict is gonna be waiting for us. We will see big
            and small groups of people hating each other to death. Having this
            much communication and being in the verge of great economical crisis
            is a deadly combo. People can easily get organized and make many
            countries suffer from either civil wars or a full blown rebellion.
            Wannabe revolutionaries are gonna ruin many second and third world
            countries. We might even see the birth of new nations and death of
            older ones. Conflict is the human nature. No escape from that. It is
            gonna get more heated with the help of communication technologies.
            We already see the birth of new cultures on internet. Most are
            retarded, memeworthy things but some can evolve into being new age
            cults or terrorist organizations.
          </p>
          <h2>MORE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
          <p>
            If you ask a 5 year old they would say we are gonna have greater
            technologies in future. This shouldn't be a surprise. Everyday you
            see something new and fancy. You can hear things like brand new
            artifical heart works like a turbofan and doesn't require you to
            have a pulse and can last 50 years inside human body. Brand new
            treatment for cancer. Brand new microchip that can cure dementia.
            Artifical limbs, monthly hardware update to your phone, brain
            computer interfaces, more sattelites being sent into space, brand
            new drugs to make you look younger and live longer, smarter
            electronics, printed human organs etc. Being a science fiction
            writer becomes harder and harder each day. People are hungry for
            technology. It doesn't even matter if it is useful or not, they
            don't even care if that shit makes things harder and more
            complicated. With cars you get no buttons nowadays, you switch
            between 5 different menus on a touch screen just to control air
            conditioner. I feel like a boomer talking about this. But there is a
            truth that consumerism creates lots of bullshit. And there is that
            "environmental friendly" technologies companies trying to shove down
            to your throat. You telling me I can buy a really expensive high end
            product and act like a saviour despite being a wasteful fucker and
            brag about saving the planet and poor shame people all at the same
            time? Sign me in. Who cares if I buy a new tesla every year and fuck
            up the planet with unchangeable lithium ion batteries, as long as I
            feel like a saviour of nature and can blame others for being poor
            dirty assholes killing the nature with their cheap gasoline powered
            cars I will pay for that ugly piece of aluminium.
          </p>
          <h2>NEXT STEP OF HUMAN EVOLUTION</h2>
          <p>
            You all probably familiar with biomechanical augmentations and
            cyborgs. You have seen some primitive versions of these in real life
            and fictional ones in moves, video games, tv series etc. You are
            also familiar with genetic engineering i assume. There are some
            great books and movies about social effects of such concepts.
            Gattaca is a great movie for example. We will not only see uneven
            distribution of money and power but we will also see those who have
            money living longer and having real physical differences than rest
            of the world in the future. We will see the most pronounced social
            classes in history maybe. In one hand there are immortal demigods,
            next step of human evolution, designed to be perfect, has all the
            physical and mental supremacy, lives longer than 100 years, has
            altered genetics, tons of hardware in their brains making all the
            calculations for them, IQ over 200, has all the wealth, has their
            own cultures cannot even be understanded by others. In the other
            hand there are the unlucky ones. The ones who are gonna stay human.
            Probably not gonna live longer than 60, gonna die from a heart
            attack or some other sickness that will be associated with poor
            people. This social class will be the 80% of population if not more.
          </p>
          <h2>FROM BRAIN TO COMPUTER</h2>
          <p>
            Brain computer interfaces(BCI's) are part of reality even today.
            Wiring a computer into human brain is a really old concept. Effects
            of such thing is really unpredictable. Getting brainfucked by
            hackers is a common concept in cyberpunk. I don't think we will be
            seeing such things anytime soon. And hacking doesn't really work the
            way science fiction depicts. Eventually we will see literal human
            brains wired into each other. And such thing is a really big threat
            to security. I am not sure if they will be able to create a
            hackproof "cyberbrains" but this won't stop people creating a
            network based on real human brains. This will allow people to
            communicate telepathically. We will go beyond words. It will create
            concepts that cannot be explained with the use of language. It is
            gonna create a whole new culture that cannot even be understanded by
            those who are not wired into that network. Maybe even language is
            gonna be an old and useless concept. Maybe we will see massive
            collective minds consists of millions of people. If human
            communications doesn't require words and can happen in miliseconds
            everything is possible. Imagine a group of people working like a
            single body. Has the same thoughts and as unified as they can be.
            Basically the same person in multiple different bodies. Circlejerk
            in a whole another level. Imagine sharing so many things with your
            social circle you end up being the exact same person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe we will be able to get totally freed from our physical bodies.
            I am not talking about uploading ourselves into computers or some
            stupid shit like that. This is not possible. But if you can take out
            the brain and put it into a jar and connect it into a network you
            can end up having an individual freed from their body and can change
            their body like changing clothes. This might even be key to
            immortality. No more brain death due to failure of a stupid internal
            organ. No more hunger, no more thirst. Can survive forever as long
            as your brain doesn't get damaged. There are other things that
            should be solved of course. Brain cells doesn't recover themselves.
            You will eventually lose all of them. But this can be fixed by magic
            of genetic engineering. Stem cell therapy is already a thing.

            I guess after this long ass post nobody would even read this. I
