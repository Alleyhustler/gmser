        <h1>WAKING UP TO 2024</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Imagine you got into a coma in 2019 and just woke up in the year
            2024. What a wild nightmare would that be? First you learn that
            there was a global pandemic that literally split apart the entire
            world, caused a chaos beyond your imagination, killed millions along
            the way, caused riots in massive scale, locked people into their
            houses, costed millions of people their mental health, their jobs
            and even turned some into homeless. And could you even imagine that
            this whole drama would result in a global chip shortage and would
            make technology advance 10 years further in only a single year? Oh,
            and also rich got even richer, poor lost whatever tiny comfort they
            already had. And you also would realize that it is now near
            impossible own a property because some whales have bought them all
            and now they are strangleholding the entire society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you were in a deep sleep, majority of the world were tech
            illiterate but now your great grandma owns a smartphone. Because it
            is impossible to survive without one. At certain times you couldn't
            leave the house without your phone and showing law enforcement a QR
            code that proves you have been vaccinated. My country at the time
            developed an app you simply had to use to even enter large shopping
            malls. They turned the entire population into livestock without even
            using subdermal chips like all the lunatics claimed vaccines had.
            And of course the whole stupid app got hacked and millions of
            citizens got their data leaked onto the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe your whole relationship with AI was shooting some Counter
            Strike bots in the head but now you are terrified of machines. Could
            you even imagine seeing photorealistic images created purely by AI?
            Only if you were balls deep into technology back in 2019. Back then
            chatbots only answered simplest of questions like "What is the
            weather like today?" but now they can code an entire mobile app from
            scratch with only a few simple prompts. AI will not only steal your
            job and your identity, it will also steal your girlfriend. Just wait
            for HenryCavillGPT 3.0, they say it will come with a mechanical
            dildo that runs in 21.000 rpm. You also would realize that internet
            is now flooded with AI generated slop and sometimes it is near
            impossible to differentiate them from the human made content.
          </p>
          <p>
            You thought the world was in chaos back in 2019? Wait until you
            learn what the crap is going on in the eastern part of the world
            nowadays. Of course you wouldn't know Russia invaded Ukraine despite
            many armchair intellectuals online claiming that it would never
            happen. And nowadays they fly kamikaze drones into each other's
            heads. Well good news is, those drones got so cheap over the years,
            you can build one yourself for under 150 bucks if you had such
            dream. You also would realize there is no such country as Syria or
            Palestine anymore. You probably couldn't even guess paramotors,
            drones, RC cars could be weaponized. Guns that go pew pew doesn't
            worth shit anymore it seems. Most valuable assets in war are now 3D
            printers, electric motors and SBCs. Modern warfare changed so much
            in last few years that, it is a totally different game now.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the worst news for you would be realizing that your million
            dollar monkey NFTs are more worthless than a pile of crap now. Yeah,
            that kinda crap didn't really catch on. But don't worry though, they
            come up with a new crypto based NFT slop once every 3 days. Maybe
            next bull run will make you the next Elon Musk. Talking about the
            CEO of shitcoins, he is now the head of DOGE. It is an official
            government branch now. And Donnie boy is still the president with
            your favorite African American businessman as his right hand, sorta.
            You cannot even make this shit up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh also, stop using the term UFO. Aliens came to visit us and now
            they consider "UFO" a racial slur. So they changed it to "UAP". What
            UAP stands for? I don't fucking know but it still describes flying
            saucers. Oh, btw that whole flying saucer thing is quite old
            fashioned now. They all upgraded to flying tic-tacs. They say it has
            a better gas mileage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes my dude, you are not dreaming. All this crap happened in last 5
            years, not even a decade. People cannot even keep up with the world
            on day to day basis and you were sleeping all along. Could be worse
            though. Imagine you have been put into coma back in 1999. Now, that
            would be a total mindfuck. You would realize Y2K bug did not destroy
            the world but Matrix was right all along. You would be a caveman in
            modern world. Back in your day bleeding edge technology was a brick
            phone and having a phonecall felt like sticking a nuclear reactor
            down to your ear hole. Now you can send a thousand dick pictures a
            second to your favorite celebrities with the same kind of
            technology. You couldn't survive a day here.
          </p>
          <p>
            If by a chance you actually been in a coma for the last 5 years,
            that was a very brief overview. Now you can go and start creating
            degenerate AI furry porn of your wildest dreams while watching the
            entire world tear itself apart.
