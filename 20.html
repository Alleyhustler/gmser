        <h1>MAYBE IT WAS ALL JUST A NIGHTMARE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            It was one of these days. Trying to sleep in my bed, it is alredy
            midnight. Thinking about exactly when my life started going down.
            Out of nowhere old memories comes back. I find myself in my
            childhood. My friends are playing with their cheap crappy water guns
            and asking me to join them. Going back to home to ask money from my
            mom. It is not much more expensive than a couple piece of chewing
            gums. Me asking money pisses off mom. She starts beating me in front
            of my friends. Trying to pull me in. My friend's mom calls me. She
            gives the money to buy two of these stupid water guns. It was the
            most shameful moment of my life probably. I don't want to take the
            money but she puts it in my hand. I wipe off my tears and go buy two
            of these stupid toys. We play until the sunbeat but I cannot fully
            enjoy it due to shame crushing my heart deep inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I remember my primary school days. I don't have much friends at
            school. All other kids are bunch of jerks. They never let me play
            with them. One day they are planning a prank on other class. Kids
            are being kids. They feel an irrational hatred towards them despite
            not knowing any of them. They take a piece of glue and put it on one
            of the desks. I am not involved in any of these since they do not
            like me. I only hear about that after they have already done their
            thing. Principal summons those who involved in this and they also
            give my name. In the principal's room they all trying to blame
            everything on me. Doesn't matter how much I cry I cannot convince
            the principal I have nothing to do with this shit. They luckily let
            us go after a warning. I want to punch these little fuckers in the
            face but I don't.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then comes my middle school memories. Oh what a nightmare it was. In
            the second or third week of the school I already got myself into
            trouble. Or should I say trouble has found me. There is this ugly
            little manlet who is trying to pick on me because he is a racist
            piece of shit. As the other fuckers. One day one of the teachers
            sees him punching me. He gets his ass slapped by this teacher. But
            he is determined to take his revenge on me. It doesn't matter that I
            am not the one who yeeted his ass. After the school ends he is
            waiting for me in front of door and punching me in the face with
            iron knuckles. My face gets swollen for about a week. I look like a
            trainwreck. And the fucker gets away with it. I still dream about
            chopping his head off with a blunt machete. After all these I spent
            3 more years in that drug infested terrorist nest. And dealt with
            equally terrible motherfuckers.
          </p>
          <p>
            What a childhood. Almost seems like I was one step away from being a
            school shooter. It is not like I never dreamed about it but I was
            always one bad day away from doing a stupid shit like that. But the
            worst memories are the ones our brains trying to hide too deep
            inside. And one day, out of nowhere, you remember it. At first you
            cannot beleive it actually happened. You start to think it was
            nothing but a nightmare. Then other details comes in. When
            eventually all the pieces fit together and the puzzle is complete
            you have a picture you cannot ever talk about. Cannot even tell it
            to yourself. Like a dead body coming to surface. You need to dig it
            deeper than ever and should not talk about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the realization kicks in. What if my life was always fucked up
            and there is nothing I can do to fix it? What if my mind got fucked
            beyond repair? Is this nightmare ever gonna end?

        <article>
          <p>
            If there is anyone still reading this website and wonders, I am not
            dead yet. But everything is shitter than ever. My anxiety and
            depression is so severe I feel like I live underwater. Sorry for the
            depressive start but I cannot lie, I fucked up even more. I was busy
            staying in my room, avoiding my family and friends. And I did not
            post anything for more than 2 months I guess. I did not want to
            complain about how terrible things are every single day. It would be
            boring to read. I feel tiny bit better now comparing with how I felt
            before. A month ago I have found my dad's pistol. With two loaded
            magazines. I cannot lie, picking the easy way out has crossed my
            mind. I was keeping one of the bullets in my drawer. The suicidal
            thoughts lasted for a while. When your mind is clouded you cannot
            think straight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am back to try harder. It is not like I can feel any worse
            than this. I am gonna get rid of the victim mindset because I
            realized this is what's holding me back. Complaining never solved
            any problem before. At least for me.
