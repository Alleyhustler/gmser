        <h1>MAYBE THIS WORLD IS ANOTHER PLANET'S HELL</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            For what sin I have sinned in my previous life that I have been sent
            to this hell? I cannot make sense of anything, anymore. I must be
            living in actual hell! No other logic can explain all this absurd
            punishment I have been receiving for the last few years. Like an
            avalanche coming down a mountain, shit gets worse and worse. None of
            it feels real anymore. I feel like either the entire world gone
            insane or it is me who fell victim to insanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who is messing up with the time constantly? Why everything is
            changing for worse with an increasing speed? I am sick of waking up
            to a whole different kind of hellscape each day. Who is to blame?
            Who is that son of a bitch turned the entire world into this
            shithole we live in? Maybe there is no one to blame and we are bunch
            of leaves floating around by the wind. So it happens that we got
            struck by a hurricane.
          </p>
          <h2>Here is the story</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in a country that can be considered the center of the
            world, Turkey. We are located in the middle of everything. Turkey is
            a bridge that connects Europe to Asia. We are neighboring European
            and Middle Eastern countries at the same time. In the north, there
            is Black Sea, separating us from Russia, Ukraine, Crimea and some
            other countries. In the south, there is Mediterranean Sea,
            separating us from Africa. Whatever the crap happens in either
            Europe or Middle East, we get affected by it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For centuries, so many civilizations has occupied the Anatolia. We
            have artifacts from Ancient Greece, Rome, Byzantine, Mesopotamian
            civilizations... There are remnants of cities that's been built tens
            of thousands of years ago, sitting beneath us. Those civilizations
            has possessed some of the biggest trade routes of the ancient times.
            Anatolia was pretty much the breeding ground of conflict throughout
            the history. The latest occupants of these lands happens to be my
            ancestors. Like many Central Asian people, there isn't much known
            about ancient Turkic history. It is just known that my ancestors
            came all the way from Central Asia. Like anything that's worth
            spilling blood over, conquering these lands comes with a curse
            impossible to break. Anatolia wouldn't see the death of so many
            civilizations otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right after my nomadic ancestors settled here, they got assimilated
            by neighboring cultures. First we accepted the sedentary lifestyle
            then we became Muslims. We lost our traditions not long after. Every
            piece of our history and culture got bastardized. Our culture has
            turned into a weird amalgamation of the west and the east. We got
            mixed with people from all around the world. As a consequence we
            have one of the widest gene pools in the world. It got to a point
            that Ottoman Sultans didn't have a single drop of Turkic blood due
            to having so many Eastern European concubines. It wasn't only a
            cultural change, it was genetic as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the consequences of occupying these lands is that you will be
            fighting for it constantly. From Seljuk Empire to Ottomans, the
            Anatolian Turks were constantly fighting against neighboring nations
            either for defending what they have or for conquering more land. The
            biggest war these lands has ever seen must be the first world war.
            It was the finishing blow for "The Sick Man of Europe" as they
            called. It destroyed the centuries old Ottoman Empire. After so much
            bloodshed and the fight over freedom, the mother Anatolia gave birth
            to modern day Turkish Republic.
          </p>

            Can a single man change the world? I am not so sure about that but
            it so happens that a single man can change a whole country for sure.
            Our father, father of all Turks, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk has built a
            secular, democratic republic out of the ashes of a corrupt empire
            that's been feeding on its people for centuries. You cannot talk
            about Turkish history without mentioning Atatürk. Even his name
            literally means "Father Turk". This surname has given to him by the
            parliament.
          </p>
          <img src="img/ataturk.jpg" alt="Ataturk in Libya" class="img" />
          <p>
            You can see his face everywhere around this country. You can see
            statues of him in every school, every town hall and every government
            building. You can see his face on the currency, sometimes even on
            the flag. What you won't to see is, his ideologies being kept alive.
            Atatürk was a highly decorated soldier and a great politician. He
            was also a great teacher. Many consider that he resurrected the long
            forgotten nationalism in this country. His kind of nationalism was
            neither chauvinistic nor racist. People built this nation are
            considered Turks, no matter the ethnicity, no matter the religion.
            Thanks to this visionary man, this country had all the women's
            rights way before some European countries even allowed women to
            vote. He gave us democracy, at least tried. He industrialized the
            whole nation. From a dying sick empire struggling with civil wars,
            famines, plagues and being relative to a modern, progressive,
            secular republic that can keep up with rest of the world. Thanks to
            his revolutions, literacy rates jumped from 2% to 30% during his
            lifetime. But those who could not understand him only complain about
            him changing the alphabet from Arabic to Latin. "He destroyed our
            culture" they say like Turks meant to read and write in Arabic.
          </p>
          <p>
            This brings us the modern day conflicts circling around him. Neither
            people who love him nor those who hate him with passion understand
            this man. If you try to learn anything about him you will come
            across nothing but lies. Be it a conservative or secularist, Muslim
            or a non-believer, right wing or the left, most people in this
            country have respect for him. There is a small minority however, the
            radical ones from both the left and the right, hate him for
            different reasons. Those who are sucking on Arabic dick hate him
            because they believe he destroyed the Islam. Those who want to
            destroy this country hate him for obvious reasons.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            There are consequences of being located in the middle of all sorts
            of different cultures as well. Turkey is one of the most hated
            nations in the world for a reason. To the western world we are bunch
            of radicalized sand people roaming around the desert despite not
            having any deserts in our country. To the Middle Eastern society we
            are just bunch of infidels worthy of god's punishment. We are too
            secular for the east, too conservative for the west. Cultural
            conflict between different groups of people in this country is
            constantly tearing us apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turkey is the epitome of oxymoron. Many of those self-righteous
            conservative Muslims in this country are deemed total heretics
            according to very own religion they worship. You can see people
            gambling, drinking alcohol, prostituting, committing adultery,
            lying, stealing but yet wanting sharia law only in this country.
            There are people who have never been in a mosque before begging for
            more mosques to be built. There are people who have spent majority
            of their lives fucking prostitutes, telling women not to wear
            indecent clothing. Biggest homosexuals in this country are also the
            most homophobic. Some even have very close relationships with our
            super conservative government.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Believe or not Turkey wasn't always a cesspool like this. Sure,
            never in our history we have had perfect politicians or a government
            except maybe earliest years of the republic but this country was
            much more tolerable not so long ago. Before 21st century, Turkey was
            at least 10 times more secular than United States. At least our
            government was. Maybe it was a little excessive even, because women
            working for the government or studying in college could not wear
            hijab. As a part of dress code. Our current leader used this to his
            benefits for many years. Why people using the word "freedom" all the
            time are always the ones trying to destroy it the most? President
            Erdoğan used the victim's mindset as a tool of propaganda by
            promising that he would ensure freedom for all. He only ensured
            freedom for his worshipers and destroyed it for the others.

          <p>
            The 2000s is the era when the downfall of this country has begun.
            Very ironically 2000s were also the years when Turkey had the most
            amount of economical growth in its history. It was one of the
            fastest growing economies in the world. We were getting showered
            with all sorts of investment. The success hasn't stopped there.
            Turkey and the prime minister Erdoğan was getting praised by the
            foreign media constantly. The support of the western world for the
            new government was simply incredible. We were winning Eurovision
            competitions year after year. We were getting millions of tourists
            from all around the world. Time magazine even praised Erdoğan for
            being "Pro-western, secular and democratic". Our currency was almost
            as valuable as USD. EU has even promised that Turkey would become a
            member by the year 2023 if our government meets the criteria. For
            many this new prime minister was some kind of a hero, for some even
            a prophet.

          />
          <p>
            Long story short, our economy was booming and our dictator was
            getting his dick sucked. But if you know anything about politics,
            western world doesn't groom dictators if they don't benefit from it.
            They were only helping our dictator grow in popularity because they
            were holding his leash. Despite how hostile Erdoğan is towards
            western nations nowadays, he was the most loyal asslicker world has
            ever seen back then. He had close relationships with president Bush.
            He even helped US troops cross the border and allowed USAF to use
            their military base located in Turkey during the invasion of Iraq.

            We cannot talk about recent political history of Turkey without
            mentioning the name Fetullah Gülen. You either don't know anything
            about him or just heard the name a few times. He is the mastermind
            behind the destruction of our nation. He was also the perpetrator of
            the 2016 coup. All you hear about this guy and the coup on western
            media is a load of bullshit. Every single citizen of Turkey
            regardless of the political background all agree that he was
            responsible for the coup. You just had to be here to see what kind
            of asshole this guy was. I will explain why you probably never heard
            of this guy despite him literally owning the entire country at some
            point.
          </p>
          <img
            src="img/gulen.jpg"
            alt="Fetullah Gulen and Erdogan Side by Side"
            class="img"
          />
          <p>
            Fetullah Gülen was the most powerful cult leader in Turkey. At some
            point he probably was the most powerful cult leader in the world as
            well. Explaining how far his hands could reach and how many strings
            he was pulling takes forever. His worshipers literally believed he
            is a messiah. I am not talking figuratively. His cult dates all the
            way back to 70s, maybe even earlier. We call them "Cemaat" or
            "Fetullahists". It was either late 80s or 90s when he really started
            to become a threat. He gained so many disciples during that time. It
            was probably 80s when he met with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He was
            nothing but a low life scum prior to joining Fetullah Gülen's cult.
            Back in the late 90s Gülen has been found guilty of "Trying to
            destroy secular nature of Turkish Republic" and escaped to United
            States. In the beginning of 2000s, Erdoğan has founded his own
            political party, AKP (Justice and Development Party). At that point
            he was the biggest worshiper of Fetullah Gülen. And Gülen financed
            most of his propaganda campaigns. Gülen is the only reason why
            Erdoğan was able to become a prime minister. How on earth a single
            nobody could gain this much power otherwise?
          </p>
          <p>
            It all begins with Erdoğan's party taking over the Turkish Republic.
            It was a democratic election, sure. This is why I have no faith in
            democracy. Ever since he became the leader, he made himself and
            those who around him super rich. Fetullah Gülen was taking the
            biggest piece from the cake back then. Not long after they took over
            the political power, Gülen started planting his spineless worshipers
            into all parts of the government. All the judges, police officers,
            soldiers, college professors, teachers, doctors were working for
            him. He helped his disciples cheat on tests by giving them the
            answers so they could infiltrate the universities. He started his
            plans of occupying all the positions in government long before
            Erdoğan was a prime minister actually but back then he could only do
            so much without occupying the most important position.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gülen started opening up schools all over the world. From Africa to
            Europe, every continent and maybe even every country had their fair
            share of his religious schools. He started brainwashing children
            into his ideologies. He wasn't only influential for Turkey, he was
            also influential for the entire Islamic society. His influence
            however was a harmful kind. They slowly started growing the span of
            this influence by persuading or even threatening people to join
            them. Those who spoke against them lost their jobs or even got
            jailed. He was practically untouchable. You couldn't do any business
            in this country without their permission, they would try their best
            to destroy your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among all the crimes these cockroaches have committed against this
            country, one of them is particularly sinister. Back when they had
            the most amount of power and were ruling the entire country
            singlehandedly, they decided to remove the biggest threat for their
            existence. The army. Turkey has a long history of coups. Whenever a
            politician crossed the line or civil unrest has peaked, the army
            took over the government. Almost all of them resulted in executions
            of some political figures. We don't have death penalty anymore
            mainly because of that reason. Gülen and his kind of people always
            feared from the army because high ranking soldiers were always loyal
            to Atatürk and his republic. The radical Islamists on the other
            hand, tried to erase his name from existence. Because of that reason
            army had to be dealt with.
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve that, they came up with a slander. They fabricated bunch
            of documents indicating that 270 generals are members of a terrorist
            group and they are planning a coup. The made up name they gave to
            this so called terrorist organization was "Ergenekon". Ergenekon is
            the oldest myth belongs to ancient Turkic people. And since these
            cocksuckers wanted to destroy everything related to pre-Islamic
            Turks, they were planning to kill two birds with one stone.
            Ergenekon never existed and all the documents they made up were
            obvious bullshit. No kind of government would take such suspicions
            seriously but our prime minister was nothing but a puppet of that
            cult leader. They started judging these army generals and most of
            them got convicted. They replaced those patriotic soldiers with the
            spineless asslickers who were gonna commit an actual coup not long
            after all this. This was probably the biggest treason against the
            Turkish Republic in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn't end here though. During the trials they started
            investigating all the archives including the deepest government
            secrets. Some of those documents that has been investigated
            contained very critical data belonged to intelligence agencies.
            Later we learned that most of them has been leaked to US
            intelligence agencies. All of the anonymous witnesses of these
            trials later been identified. As you might guess majority of them
            were cult members, literal terrorists and some mafia bosses. Back in
            2019 they released convicted army generals after finally realizing
            that it was all a slander but it was too late. Many of these
            soldiers took their own lives, some died because of poor treatment
            they have received.

            How convenient is that this man, Fetullah Gülen started saying
            really nice things about Christians and Jews as well as US
            government not long after they opened their arms to him. He is
            currently residing in Pennsylvania. As far as I can see he has
            really close relationships with US politicians and even other
            religious leaders such as the Pope himself. I am not saying that he
            was a CIA puppet but he was a CIA puppet. Still is. Just like I
            said, not long after they seized the government, western world
            started showering this country with all sorts of investment and
            financial aid. Erdoğan was getting his dick sucked by the western
            media not so long ago. He was never that "Secular, democratic,
            western-friendly leader" they deemed. They cannot be that stupid or
            ignorant. Their sympathy for our dictator was purposeful.

            I have no such words to explain how useful this guy was for the US
            government. His influence over Islamic world could be very
            beneficial and his tyranny over the Turkish Republic have been
            heavily exploited to serve for political gains of US and Europe.
            Their investment was really fruitful for some time. One of the
            examples of this was the so called "Peace process with the Kurdish
            people".

            You probably never heard of the terrorist organization called PKK
            (Kurdish Worker's Party). That's because they never use that name on
            the western media, they simply call them "The Kurds" despite
            majority of Kurdish people standing against these terrorists. They
            have a long history. Ever since late 80s they killed tens of
            thousands of people including civilians. Throughout the 90s they
            killed dozens of primary school teachers working in the Eastern
            Anatolia just because they didn't want formal education to get in
            the way of their indoctrination. PKK is simply a communist guerilla
            group that's been built for one purpose. Taking over the significant
            portion of Eastern Turkey and creating an autonomous land over
            there. Their propaganda includes spewing bunch of lies about how
            government mistreated the Kurdish people throughout the history.
            They outright killed those who left the organization and blamed it
            on Turkish army in the past. People still buy their bullshit
            regardless.

            They bombed the hell out of large cities, burned down public
            transport which in one incident a pregnant women has burnt to death
            inside a bus, they blocked the highways and killed many officers
            working for the government, they massacred plenty of villages and
            killed everyone including children, they attacked military bases
            with suicide bombers and many other atrocious crimes. Great portion
            of their victims were also Kurdish people. If locals refused to
            cooperate, they have been killed. 90s were some rough years for this
            country but at the end of it, it was mostly over. Their leader got
            caught and sent to prison and remaining terrorists were mostly
            hiding in Northern Iraq. Until Erdoğan became the prime minister.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of nowhere they decided to make peace with these terrorists.
            First they pardoned all of them then they opened up the borders to
            accept those who were hiding in Northern Iraq. They literally let
            them in without even judging them in court. These so called "Peace
            efforts" were another reason why western world started praising the
            hell out of Erdoğan. It was one of the prerequisites of Turkey's
            acceptance to EU. Of course Turkey being a part pf EU was never the
            plan, just another marketing campaign. The ultimate goal of this
            hassle was to build an autonomous state in the eastern Anatolia.
            Pretty much like Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey is the first country
            legally recognized their existence by the way. So, all those stories
            about Erdoğan mistreating Kurdish people is a load of bullshit. They
            only started saying that after he became no longer useful. There are
            some incidents of smugglers getting killed after trying to cross the
            border. And guess who was responsible for that? Their killings been
            ordered by the Fetullah Gülen's cult. So that it could be used for
            propaganda.

            All of this nonsense has ended after the imprisoned leader of PKK,
            Abdullah Öcalan started demanding outlandish things from the
            government. This is what happens if you treat terrorists like human
            beings. They get spoiled very easily. While all this was happening,
            I was living in Eastern Anatolia and saw them parade the terrorist
            with my own eyes. I have experienced all forms of discrimination
            while I was living there. I guess being a Turk in Turkey is not
            acceptable anymore. We were living in constant fear back then. Some
            places I used to visit got bombed to the ground with suicide bombers
            after we moved from there. Our house got marked with red paint
            because my father is a soldier. I don't know who did that and what
            they were planning is beyond me but getting your door marked by a
            stranger is one of the creepiest things you can experience I can
            assure. During the first week I have spent there I have seen people
            throwing molotov cocktails at the police. I got tear gassed by
            accident so many times.

            Ever since Erdoğan became a prime minister we were getting fucked in
            the ass as a country. After the unavoidable death of democracy he
            gained more power than ottoman sultans even. Our new presidency
            system made him untouchable. Even if you raised your voice against
            him, you would face imprisonment. Calling him a dictator ironically
            would put you in trouble. It's like a king punishing his people for
            being called a king. He can pass whatever laws he want, he can
            punish whoever he wants, he can steal as much money as he wants from
            the treasury which he had done many times. And yet, he won't stop
            uttering the word "democracy" every single time he gives a speech.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many ways Erdoğan is the antagonist of Atatürk. Atatürk was a
            dictator for sure, we never had anything like democracy in our
            history prior to Turkish Republic. Atatürk used his tyrannical
            powers to bring democracy, Erdoğan used his democratic powers to
            bring tyranny. This is the difference between a good dictator and an
            evil one. Our government tried its best to erase Atatürk's name from
            existence by spreading most disgusting forms of slander. They called
            him an illegitimate child, they called him a jew like it is
            something to be ashamed of, they called him an alcoholic, they
            literally said he was a British spy despite him winning many wars
            against the Brits. Doesn't matter that all of them was a load of
            bullshit, their braindead followers ate them all up.

            There are certain things in life constantly reminds you what kind of
            shithole you live in. For the last 20 years we were losing bits and
            pieces of our freedom. As a result we have no kind of freedom to
            lose anymore. Our mighty government controls every aspect of our
            lives. First thing Erdoğan had done when he became our leader was to
            censor the TV channels and the media. Pre-2000s TV in Turkey was
            totally unhinged. If you wonder what would happen if TV channels had
            no control you should take a look at 80s and 90s Turkish TV. Those
            were the most colorful years for sure. Nowadays TV is nothing but a
            tool of propaganda. Right after this TV censorship, internet
            censorship followed. I remember the days when Youtube was blocked.
            Other social media sites got their fair share of censorship not long
            after. I guess at this point Twitter got blocked and opened again
            12-15 times before. In every major event our government blocks the
            whole social media so that people won't be able to learn what is
            happening. They cover their assess by doing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            And you better watch your mouth if you don't want to get sued for
            talking shit about government. They might even claim that you are a
            terrorist for vocalizing your discomfort. If you do not believe
            everything in this country is perfect, you are either a terrorist or
            a spy. And do not think that any form of parody or figurative speech
            won't be taken seriously. Even if they sense that you are remotely
            cynical, you will get sued. These eyes have seen a 15yo getting
            arrested for criticizing the government. Even being an infant won't
            save you. I am waiting for the day they will start arresting
            toddlers.

            Many journalists has been arrested since the beginning of this
            tyranny. They completely took over the media. 80% of the media
            corporations are licking his ass. It is possible to see them talking
            about how entire world is jealous of our leader every single day. I
            just wish you could see how fucked up things really are. I cannot
            stand staring at TV for more than 5 minutes. It literally gives me
            severe headache. How it is possible that every single thing they say
            is a total lie? At this point our media is the equivalent of
            Russian, Chinese and North Korean media.
          </p>
          <p>
            They started squeezing out as much money as they can from their
            citizens as well. In the beginning of the century they brought so
            many new forms of taxes. Nowadays they take almost %400 tax from
            motorized vehicles if they have engine displacement bigger than
            1.6L. It was not enough though, we have a tax called "Special
            Consumption Tax". This tax is added on top of all other taxes and
            they take this tax from certain items that's considered "luxury". Do
            you know what is considered luxury? From cars and motorcycles to
            carbonated beverages. Basically anything other than most basic food
            items. And do not even think about importing stuff from foreign
            countries. They will fuck you up so bad that you are gonna wish you
            were an actual drug smuggler. All the difficulty of importing stuff
            aside, you will pay ridiculous amount of taxes and the value of
            whatever you were buying will be determined by the government. If
            government decides that whatever you buy costs 5k you will pay 5k
            equivalent of taxes. If you import stuff in bulk, they will ask you
            to build an import-export company so they can tax you properly. We
            simply drive the most expensive cars in the world, we use most
            expensive Iphones and Macbooks, we buy the most expensive
            electronics and yet people keep sucking the dicks of those thieves
            who are responsible for all this.

            Atatürk once said "The Republic of Turkey cannot be a country of
            sheikhs, dervishes, and disciples. The truest, most real order is
            the order of civilization". Unfortunately, today his heritage became
            a toy in the hands of Islamic cults. To say that Erdoğan's
            government favored all those Islamic cults is an understatement.
            Erdoğan himself is a product of an Islamic cult after all. People of
            Turkish Republic constantly get fucked in the ass by cult leaders,
            sometimes literally. These cockroaches been devouring this nation
            for many years. Even before 21st century, these low life monkeys has
            murdered so many intellectuals because they were not some mindless
            worshipers sucking on their sheikh's dick. In today's Turkey, they
            can get away with all sorts of crimes they have been committing for
            the last 20 years.

            At some point in history, religious cults were totally outlawed. You
            will understand why it was such a great decision. You first need to
            understand how these cults actually work. Many of these cults in
            Turkey has evolved into a religion on their own pretty much like
            their Christian counterparts in America. They possess more power
            than they should. Their disciples are totally devoted to their
            sheikhs or imams. So much so that, they see them as literal prophets
            or even a sort of deity. One particular cult even believes that
            their leader is even greater than the Allah. You can see their
            mindless worshipers barking like a dog in front of their sheikhs,
            you can see them going apeshit during their prayers and doing lots
            of unintelligible things, you can even hear stories about how they
            are drinking their sheikh's piss.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of these cults have their own boarding schools. These schools
            are used for the most intense form of brainwashing. Once a young
            mind falls victim to them, they will lose all their ties with the
            outer world. They won't let you use cellphones, they won't let you
            watch TV, they won't allow you to speak anyone outside of the cult.
            Kids that's been abducted by these cults won't receive any formal
            education either. They will deprive you from most of your basic
            needs. The brainwashing is so severe that it can cause
            schizophrenia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any kind of religious cult cannot be imagined without sexual abuse,
            especially against minors. Our cults are infamous for all sorts of
            child abuse. Very recently a high ranking cult member got arrested
            for getting married with a 6yo. Since we don't have any justice in
            this country, I am not sure for how long this pedophile will stay
            there. In many of these religious boarding schools, kids get
            sexually abused either by other cult members or the cult leaders
            themselves. There are countless examples of young people taking
            their own lives because of the sexual and physical abuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from sexual abuse, there is the psychological torture many
            people have to endure. We have a huge problem with college dorms
            that are being ran by these cults. Since government dorms are
            overcrowded, most students don't have any chance but staying there.
            And you bet your ass you will be forced to worship. They won't even
            allow you to study. You will be asked to eat ass. You will be asked
            to donate your money. You will be asked to listen to their
            propaganda. Again, very recently a medicine student committed
            suicide because he could not take it anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these cults are so perverted that their sheikhs will
            literally fuck their worshipers, their worshipers' wives and other
            family members for sake of "blessing" them. And the most tragic part
            is, most of these cults are practically untouchable thanks to their
            ties with the government. Government will even allow them to preach
            in public schools. In one incident, a teacher of sort got arrested
            for molesting more than 40 children aging between 7-16. First thing
            our dictator had done was defending this cult and calling it an
            isolated incident. The same cult still receives financial help from
            the government. Our tax money is literally feeding pedophiles.

            There isn't a single thing in this country that hasn't been ruined
            by the Erdoğan's government. Education is one of them. Back when
            Fetullah Gülen and his cult was feeding on this country, they
            imprisoned so many professors for the stupidest reasons, so that
            they could replace them with their spineless worshipers. Just like
            they did with the army. They changed the education system so many
            times. They bastardized it so bad that, kids today doesn't learn a
            single piece of true information. They firstly removed evolution
            from the biology curriculum. Then they removed certain classes such
            as geology and geography. They replaced them with religious classes.
            They have opened up so many religious schools as well. Every piece
            of foundation related to science and education have been handed to
            braindead retards with religious backgrounds. As a result, a whole
            generation of people turned into uneducated, retarded, degenerate
            bastards. Most people in this country doesn't know anything about
            about their own history. They barely can speak their own language.

            Believe or not, these lands used to have so many natural beauties
            beyond imagination prior to getting destroyed. They have ruined many
            of these beauties in order to put concrete on top of concrete.
            Construction is a booming business in this country and many
            construction companies are sucking on the tits of government. As a
            result so many of the preserved lands and agricultural areas has
            been turned into concrete hell. So many rare geological wonders have
            been destroyed for profit. So many forests has been burnt to the
            ground so they can be replaced by man made abominations. So many
            lakes has dried up. So many water sources are gone due to drought.

            All the historical artifacts that were able to stand the test of
            time for centuries has been ruined in a couple decades. The curse of
            these lands still persist to this day. We have had so many gorgeous
            looking castles, monasteries, churches, mosques, ancient theaters.
            Most either has been ruined in the name of "restoration" or has been
            totally destroyed. In no other country you can see something as
            stupid as building a glass ceiling on top of a historically
            significant palace. In no other country you can see something as
            stupid as a museum being turned into a mosque. In no other country
            you can see ancient mesopotamian artifacts getting blown up by
            dynamite in order to build a dam. Only in a middle eastern shithole.
            Funny thing is, shitbrained bastards committing these crimes against
            our culture are complaining about not being able to read the
            tombstones of their ancestors due to Atatürk changing our alphabet
            to Latin alphabet. But they are okay with shitting on the graves of
            those same ancestors.

            You probably start to think that for how long people need to get
            fucked until they open their eyes. I talked about how Erdoğan was
            backed by the western nations but trust me I don't blame anyone but
            my people for everything that has happened to us. Maybe being bunch
            of shameless whores is in the blood. There are many cocksuckers in
            this country who would gladly hand their wives and daughters to
            president Erdoğan. Some even say that openly. These are the same
            people boasting about dignity and integrity. Yet, none of them have
            any problems with sucking the dicks of very own traitors that has
            completely destroyed all our values. Mankind are weird kind of

            You need to understand the psyche of lower class to make any sense
            of this. For many years, lower class of this country has been pushed
            around because of their ignorance and stupidity. Their voices could
            not be heard due their inferiority complex. Being ignorant was
            something to be ashamed of back then. Only type of people you could
            see being represented on TV were the middle class people. Those who
            were educated and could speak very well. On top of that, old
            fashioned values and virtues of the lower class remaining from the
            stone age was getting mocked. Their retrograde way of thinking had
            no place in a modern world. Politicians were nothing but aliens to
            them. They all spoke big fancy words they could not understand. They
            wanted someone to represent them in the field of politics.

            That someone was the marketing face of this country's destruction,
            Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He had a massive PR team making him look and
            sound the way that appeals to common everyday folks. He was always
            talking about how he did not possess any wealth and how he is one of
            the them. The religious values of the people had to be exploited as
            well. So many times he gave speech in front of people, holding the
            Qur'an. His PR team was constantly pushing the idea of his political
            party being the only Islamic party. They painted him as a
            sympathetic young man who is worried about his people. He was
            constantly vocalizing the problems of this country with poverty. He
            promised people that they will raise a religious generation.
            Ironically they have raised a nihilistic generation by making the
            youth of this country very hateful of everything they defend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long after he came into power, they started praising the
            ignorance and pointing their fingers at the upper middle class. They
            needed to find an enemy to fuel the hatred. They have called this
            enemy "White Turks". Very idiotic term to describe the upper middle
            class. People in this country doesn't differentiate by the color and
            there are no "White Turks". Since majority of the population are the
            lower class, the middle class could just be ignored. These elite
            group of people looking down on common everyday folks had to be
            demonized. They outright said that educated people are the root of
            every problem in this country. Sounds like some shit you could only
            read in George Orwell novels but Turkey is not a fictional land.
            They outright spread lies about how these elite Atatürkist people
            victimized the poor conservative folks just because they wanted
            religious freedom. To fuel the hatred even more, they produced so
            many propaganda movies and TV shows where the bad guy was always a
            secular Atatürkist picking up on poor lower class conservative
            people. They were so good at their job, even those same upper middle
            class dissidents they were trying to smear started to believe it.

            After the masks fell off, the same generous, sympathetic, politician
            of your family has turned into a tyrannical monster feeding on
            people of his country. The same guy who once said that he doesn't
            possess any wealth is now living in a palace built by our own tax
            money.

            For many, breaking point of recent Turkish history was the 2016
            coup. But in reality it started way earlier. Some people could even
            see it coming. I already said that Fetullah Gülen was the mastermind
            behind the fall of this nation. Erdoğan owes him everything. But it
            so happened that relationship between these two political figures
            has worsened over the years. Power is the most addictive type of
            drug. Power high becomes the most irresistible type of high once you
            get a taste of it. I don't know exactly what happened between these
            two but I assume that Erdoğan just couldn't stand the fact that he
            was nothing but a puppet. He wanted to get rid of Gülen and his
            cult. This wasn't an easy task because many of his worshipers were
            also Fetullah Gülen's worshipers. After the tides have turned, many
            of them picked their sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all started in 2013 if I am not wrong. Suddenly this godsend
            cleric who is determined to "bring back the Islam" has became a
            terrorist. Doesn't matter that they all sucked his dick for so many
            years, the media turned their heads against him. All of his castles
            were falling down, one by one. Many of his disciples got arrested.
            Desperate times call for desperate measures. Just before government
            started to investigate the soldiers, they have committed a coup. But
            not all soldiers were loyal to him thankfully. He could only use
            small portion of army's resources. Their plan was failed from the
            beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still remember the day it all happened. It was the evening and I
            was watching TV up until we got a call from my dad. He was telling
            us to stay inside. On the TV there was a reporter woman reading a
            declaration. It was about a group of people taking over the
            government. They called themselves "Peace in the homeland
            committee". This comes from a famous quote of Atatürk, "Peace at
            Home, Peace in the World". They also identified themselves as a
            group of Atatürkist soldiers. Despite this old fart trying to
            destroy his name for many years, he was hiding behind Atatürk's name
            in the last ditch effort of taking over this country. Even an
            earthworm has more spine than these people.
          </p>
          <img src="img/coup.jpg" alt="2016 coup" class="img" />
          <p>
            I watched our parliament building getting bombed to the ground by
            fighter jets, I have watched tanks roaming around the capital city,
            I have watched perpetrators bombing the police stations. While all
            that was happening our supreme leader was about to escape. His car
            was moving towards the airport. He called the TV channels during the
            live broadcast and asked for people to defend the homeland. Soon
            after this, people started filling the streets. After the sunrise,
            everything was pretty much over. All the soldiers attempting the
            coup got caught and punished, some paid the price with their lives.
            Low ranking soldiers didn't know what the hell even happened paid
            the biggest price. They were just following the orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            After everything calmed down a bit, they started arresting all of
            the Gülen followers. What a coincidence that government could
            identify all of them like they were the ones who gave them all of
            their titles and jobs. From judges to soldiers, teachers to doctors,
            all those who were devout worshipers of Fetullah Gülen got arrested
            and punished with the highest sentence they could get. Later they
            said that most of these people got their jobs by cheating. Saying
            that people are getting jobs they don't deserve due to corruption
            could result in getting called a traitor not so long ago. How
            ironic. Lots and lots of people who got arrested had nothing to do
            with Fetullah Gülen as well. If you had any material related to
            Gülen cult, either one of his books or the newspapers he owned, you
            were in some deep shit. Those who were the biggest asslickers
            though, got away with it because they were loyal enough to Erdoğan.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the our supreme leader, he declared himself a hero.
            So as his worshipers. Despite attempting to escape like a rat and
            calling people to save his ass. Despite him being the most devout
            Gülen worshiper himself not so long ago. Despite being responsible
            for all the corruption resulted in Fetullah Gülen taking over a huge
            chunk of the army as well as the whole damn country. He got many
            more followers after all this. He used this coup as a tool of
            propaganda and started accusing people for being Fetullahists. Can
            you comprehend what kind of mental asylum this whole country is?
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            It didn't take much long to replace Fettulahists with other kinds of
            bootlickers. Nothing has changed. They kept corrupting the hell out
            of this country. All the positions in the government are possessed
            by Erdoğan worshipers and their family members. Not a single one of
            them is competent enough for their jobs. They kept their old
            practices. All the tests and job interviews are still fixed and only
            those who can suck enough dicks are accepted. They still help their
            worshipers pass the exams and tests by giving them the answers. The
            army is now full of Erdoğan worshipers instead of those who were
            loyal to Fetullah Gülen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not so long ago Erdoğan's government was shitting on all forms of
            nationalism. Now they suddenly turned into most fierce nationalists,
            very ironically. The same kind of people who were cheering for
            terrorist being released in the name of "peace" are now accusing
            people of being PKK members. Erdoğan went even a step further and
            suddenly started praising the Atatürk despite how he was shitting on
            him for many years. It's all in the name of getting votes. When it
            comes to religious cults, it didn't take long to find a replacement
            for Gülen's cult. All their boarding schools and student dorms have
            been taken away from them and given to all sorts of other cults.
          </p>
          <p>
            They turned the whole government into a family business. Erdoğan's
            son in law once was our minster of finance. That cocksucker has
            escaped to France after ruining the economy. Many of the
            congresspeople started hiring their friends and relatives. A single
            congressman has at least 3 consultants and most of them are the
            closest friends and relatives of those congressmen. It takes a whole
            army of people to rule this country yet we are still not moving
            anywhere. Maybe that's because we live in a dictatorship and the
            choice is nothing but an illusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the Erdoğan's son in law, Berat Albayrak who started ruining
            the economy with his retarded policies. Not long after he was gone,
            they replaced him with another bootlicker. They needed someone to
            blame so they kept firing minsters and hiring even more incompetent
            ministers. The Central Bank of Turkish Republic has totally lost
            their autonomy. They fired their manager and replaced him with a
            puppet. They took control over the entire financial system. But when
            they screwed everything up, they accepted none of the
            responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not long ago when Erdoğan said "I am an economist". He can be
            anything he wants since he doesn't have an actual college degree. He
            shouldn't even be elected as a prime minister by the law because of
            that but as I said so many times, he got backed by some really
            powerful people. And since this delusional cunt believed that he
            could fix the economy, he lowered the interest rates while we were
            dealing with some serious inflation despite common sense saying that
            you should do the opposite. We are the only country in the world
            doing something as stupid as this. It is all in the name of "Muh
            religion". This action resulted in banks making a lot more money
            then they used to make despite what most idiots in this country
            thinks. Those interest rates are not the same interest rates that's
            been taken from you if you had loans.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this stage we are dealing with hyperinflation despite government
            saying that inflation is nothing more than 80%. They are altering
            the numbers. They even made it illegal for people to talk about
            inflation rates. You cannot say that "The real inflation is a lot
            more than 100%" without getting in trouble. Those who cannot
            tolerate free speech are always the biggest cowards. They are very
            scared. Most people in this country hate them with passion. Their
            chances of winning another election is slim to none. Even if by a
            miracle it happens, it will totally destroy this country.
          </p>

            What happens if you start losing all your votes and become the most
            hated man in the whole country? It so happens that you can import
            votes from other countries. There are currently 13 million refugees
            in this country. Most are from Syria and Afghanistan. More than 3
            million of these got citizenship over the last 10 years despite
            government saying that they are not here permanently at first. Now
            our dictator says that they will stay here because they are our
            Muslim brothers. Right after the war in Ukraine we also got hundreds
            of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian refugees, because why not?
            Turkey is the dumping ground of all kinds of third world refugees
            after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long after our Muslim brothers came here, they started
            committing all sorts of crimes. From stealing to sexual assault.
            Wherever you go, you see nothing but these sand monkeys. So many
            places in Turkey are full of Arabic signs. It is not enough that our
            government pay these refugees a monthly salary for coming here and
            sexually assaulting our women and children, we must also put Arabic
            signs and landmarks everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might say that "How can you be so racist, these poor people are
            victims of war". Believe or not most of the Syrians living in this
            country travel across the border and visit their homeland every
            single year. If their lives are in danger, how the hell such thing
            can happen? And most of these cocksuckers live better lives than
            most of the lower class citizens of Turkey. Being a refugee in this
            country grants you more rights than being a citizen. They get free
            healthcare, a salary, free housing, free education and even
            citizenship if they worship the government. Most of the universities
            has a quota for refugees and they don't even need to pass the test.
            If you are a citizen you need to work your ass off for college
            education, if you are a refugee, it is effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            How they pay off this hospitality you ask? By acting like bunch of
            uncivilized monkeys. Wherever you go, you see hundreds of refugees
            roaming around, leaving their trash behind, bothering people and
            outright starting fights. Nowadays they started ganging up on
            people. There are lots and lots of armed gangs consisting of
            refugees. Some of these cockroaches, specially the ones coming from
            Afghanistan are jihadists. Most of the Afghan refugees are Taliban
            members. It is hard to understand these jihadist cocksuckers. You
            are leaving your shithole country for a civilized nation, you want
            to turn that civilized nation into the same shithole you came from.
            Why don't you just fuck off to whatever shithole you came from?
          </p>
          <p>
            It was last year when a terrorist attack in the middle of Istanbul
            has occurred. The perpetrator was a Syrian women. Of course, first
            thing government has done was censoring the media so that we cannot
            know what the hell is happening. No TV channels has mentioned this
            for the first 12 hours or so. They also blocked the social media. We
            still don't know what was the motive behind all this. And what they
            did to prevent something like this from happening ever again?
            Removing the bench seats from the street where this bombing has
            happened. While this was happening, our mister of the interior was
            participating in an opening in Syria. What a fucking joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            What our government is doing to solve this refugee problem? Nothing.
            You will get called racist, xenophopic or even a terrorist if you
            say that you don't want refugees in this country. They will outright
            say that "All the separatist terrorists in this country doesn't want
            refugees". Very ironically it is quite the opposite. Those
            separatist groups literally want refugees to stay in this country so
            that they can take advantage of a civil war that might happen in the
            near future.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are lots and lots of media corporations spreading refugee
            propaganda started popping up like mushrooms in the last 5 years.
            Almost all of them are funded by Europe. They all tell you stories
            about poor Syrian refugees not being treated well but none of them
            talk about all those crimes they have been committing. A couple
            years ago, a 2yo baby got raped by one of these monkeys. Most of the
            media corporations either didn't talk about it or they didn't
            mention his nationality. Why they are funding these newly built
            media corporations and youtube channels you might ask. Because
            all-mighty Europeans, saviors of the third world, doesn't want these
            monkeys in their homeland either but they will call you a racist if
            you refuse to keep them in your country. They only accept blue eyed,
            blonde haired Slavic refugees and they don't feel shy to say that
            they are nothing like those middle easterners. They paid 3 billion
            dollars to our government so that we can keep the unwanted refugees
            here. Our government spent more than 70 billion dollars for them in
            total. It all was an investment for the upcoming elections.

            Perhaps there isn't any kind of power that is more destructive than
            the nature itself. You would think that wrath of the mother earth
            can curb the arrogance of mankind but we are too blind to take any
            lessons. We don't learn even when nature topples our empire of
            concrete. Our collective memory resembles an old man with dementia.
            I cannot believe how quickly people forget everything.

            Another curse of these lands is being the most seismically active
            place on earth. The earth tries to kill you, if you dare to live
            here. I have experienced more than 4 earthquakes over 7 magnitude in
            my entire life. Any kind of earthquake can be quite scary but an
            earthquake over 7 magnitude is quite a spectacle. Everything around
            you starts to squeak and shake. You live through the longest minutes
            of your life. Things start falling off the shelves, lights go out,
            people start screaming, you lose your balance so bad you cannot even
            walk. It is impossible to describe that desperation. You just sit
            down and wait to see if the earth will swallow you as whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the time after an earthquake that big, many smaller
            earthquakes follow. Ground keeps shaking for several months,
            sometimes 100 times a day. If it doesn't give you the anxiety of
            your life, you must be the calmest person on earth. I have been
            through it so many times and you never get used to it. You won't be
            able to sleep for several days. You will feel like shaking all the
            time. Sometimes it is hard to tell if ground is shaking or is it
            just your brain playing one of its dirty tricks on you.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was 1999, I was too young to remember. We got hit by an
            earthquake that killed more than 40.000 people. Most of those
            buildings that got destroyed were not built properly. They all
            crumbled like biscuits. Everything has turned to dust in matter of
            minutes. This was the biggest natural disaster in our history. It
            wasn't the first one, it wasn't even the biggest earthquake but it
            was the one that killed the most amount of people in our recent
            history. People all talked about it for several years then they
            totally forgot about it. We got all sorts of new regulations for the
            construction industry. Those who were responsible for building the
            10 story graveyards all got away with it. And none of those
            regulations prevented greedy bastards from building improper houses.
            Government didn't give a damn about inspecting the buildings either.

          <p>
            Then we got hit by several other earthquakes that were almost as
            big, years later. It is the same story every single time. People
            lose their lives under the rubble, we talk about it for a while,
            nobody gets punished for building those concrete death traps,
            government tries to find someone to blame, we all forget about it.
            And the most ironic of all, we have been warned about these
            earthquakes years before they all happened, thanks to scientists.
            Government did not even bother funding the research for seismic
            faults sitting beneath us. Now we have a proper map of all those
            faults. Nobody can predict when exactly these earthquakes will
            happen but they can say if they will happen and if they will happen
            soon or not.

            I was sleeping when we got hit by a M7.8 earthquake. It was the
            scariest moment of my life by far. It was shaking so bad, I fell off
            my bed. After it stopped, I was relieved. It was the afternoon when
            I tried to get some sleep for the second time. And right at that
            moment, we got hit by another big earthquake. It was a M7.5. Mother
            earth has no remorse indeed. Maybe we are getting punished for
            disrespecting her, challenging her and for being unimaginably
            stupid. This earthquake was about to happen, we all knew this.
            Scientists have warned us. Yet, our mighty government didn't give a
            crap about preparing for such disaster. Nobody could know that it
            was gonna be even worse than we imagined, but shit could be a lot
            less fucky if they simply could pull their heads off their asses.
            Would you believe if I said that a couple years ago government has
            pardoned all those who built illegal structures? If you built a
            second story for your house without a permit, you could simply get
            away with it thanks to our government. They even marketed this on
            TV. Not only that, just before the elections they also pardoned all
            sorts of criminals. All of the murderers, rapists and thieves got
            released. Turkey is the only country where government breaks the law
            to gain support of people. These vultures is the only reason we lost
            more than 50.000 people to this earthquake if you believe the
            official numbers. The real numbers are probably something like
            150.000.
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot simply imagine the shitshow that happened after all this.
            Everything bad could happen has happened. It doesn't help that we
            are being ruled by bunch of cannibals either. At the first 20 hours
            or so, government couldn't simply send help to majority of those
            provinces that got affected by the earthquake but they simply lied
            about it. They said that their rescue teams have arrived to all
            those cities, towns and villages, which was a lie. There are many
            organizations to manage this kind of disaster in Turkey. Main one is
            called "Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency" or simply
            "AFAD". This one has been built by the government itself. Right
            after they destroyed many of the great charity organizations to
            squeeze out more money out of them. We also have an organization
            called "Red Crescent". It is the equivalent of Red Cross. It was
            suppose to be an independent organization prior to their manager
            getting replaced by a cocksucker. In prior earthquakes, this
            organization have handed great portion of charity money to Islamic
            cults. In this earthquake they started selling supplies and tents to
            other charity organizations instead of delivering them to people in
            need. There are also rumors about them selling blood that's been
            donated to them. You cannot believe the amount of corruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            What people got after they started complaining about the help they
            haven't received for several days? They have been called "Ignoble
            scoundrels" by the president and other government officials. They
            simply lied to our faces by saying that they are doing their best to
            help people. 12 days after the earthquake there were some places
            that didn't receive any help at all. People from all around the
            country has came together to help people but they were far from
            being organized and they could only do so much. Rescue teams from
            all around the world also came for help but the kind of treatment
            they faced with cannot be put into words. For the first several
            days, they kept these foreign rescue teams on hold. They made them
            wait at the airports for days. During the most critical moments of
            the disaster.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew another kind of hatred for mankind after all the shit I have
            seen. While volunteers and foreign rescue teams were saving people
            under the rubble, the government backed organizations, mainly AFAD
            were shooing them right at the moment they save someone, just to
            pose in front of cameras. There was even a first responder who took
            a selfie video with an earthquake victim child on his arms, just for
            those sweet social media credits. That little child has died because
            of the improper treatment. You cannot understand the span of my
            hatred for attention whores. Tons and tons of attention craving
            thots on social media started spreading misinformation right after
            the disaster. I just wish I would go blind and deaf just not to see
            this kind of degeneracy. We have even seen degenerate zoomer
            cumstains making fun of the victims. There was an onlyfans bitch
            claiming that she would donate all of her earnings to charity just
            as a marketing strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Would you believe that so many people trapped under the rubble were
            tweeting for help? Volunteers managed to save so many people by just
            looking through those tweets. So many people filmed and shared their
            last moments through social media. Quite a surreal scene. What our
            government has done to help those people you ask? They blocked the
            Twitter because people were raising too much complaint. It was not
            enough that they didn't do jack shit to help people, they also
            prevented volunteers from helping.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there were people still waiting for a rescue, they started
            rescuing valuable items instead. There are rumors about people
            making rescue teams go after their valuables at gunpoint. They also
            wanted to get it over with as soon as possible. So they stopped the
            rescue way earlier than they should, while there were hundreds maybe
            thousands of alive people buried under the rubble. Most of those
            people got crushed under the bulldozers. Many of the foreign rescue
            teams has left because they didn't want to be a part of this crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            While thousands of people were suffocating or freezing to death
            under the buildings, millions of refugees who infested this country
            started looting and stealing. Armed gangs started stopping aid
            trucks and robbing them. There are cases where they called
            volunteers on the phone and robbed them after they fell for their
            insidious traps. They even robbed the equipment that was being used
            by the rescue teams. Luckily though, some of them got caught and
            beaten by the angry mob. I have never enjoyed watching someone
            getting beaten to death this much before. These ungrateful
            cockroaches were the first ones who backstabbed our people. They
            won't stop marketing them as our "Muslim brothers" even after all
            this crap.
          </p>
          <p>
            While all that was happening, the media was busy sucking the
            government's dick. They never showed any of those looters on camera,
            they did not even mention it. If people started to complain about
            the lack of help, they cut the broadcast. They never showed those
            places that hasn't received any help. They kept sucking the
            government's dick by mentioning how "hard" our government works to
            save people. You turn on the TV to see what the crap is going on but
            you end up listening to a spineless cocksucker talking about how
            comfy are those tents our government has provided to the victims,
            for several hours. There are a few TV channels mentioned all the
            problems those people were facing with but not long after that, they
            got fined by the government. They made it clear that if you are
            saying government officials are bunch of incompetent cocksuckers,
            you will face punishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these crimes against humanity are only a fraction of what
            actually happened. As a result, several provinces has turned to
            dust, millions of people ended up homeless, tens of thousands of
            people died and our fragile economy is about to collapse. Those
            cannibals ruling this country are still getting praised by large
            portion of the population. We never learn, we never will. Disaster
            could be averted if government could just do its job by mandating
            the regulations but there is no money to be made and there are no
            political gains that way. Government turned its head against those
            who built improper housing by releasing an amnesty and people all
            cheered for it.
          </p>
          <p>TL;DR: We live in a clown world indeed.</p>

          <p>
            It's been almost half a year without an update. I spent most of that
            time living in fear and anxiety. Firstly the political unrest and
            economic crisis, then all these natural disasters. God has a dark
            sense of humor. I will come back 10 days later after posting this
            and will talk more about personal stuff. I think I already dumped a
            massive wall of text nobody will even attempt reading. Sorry for my
            offensive language. If things I said bothered you, you can get your
            offended ass out of my shitty ass blog. Thanks for reading. See you
            next time.
