        <h1>THE GREAT HUMAN INFLATION</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I talked about how much space we waste in this universe as
            humankind. How much significance we have and how long we probably
            gonna last. I also mentioned the human infliation. Talked about how
            there are almost 8 billion people living in this planet. It is mind
            boggling. Everyday 150 thousand people dies and nobody fucking
            cares. It would only be a big deal if those 150.000+ people would
            die in a single incident. And majority of these people are living
            suboptimal lifes. Maybe 80% of them. And we keep breeding like horny
            fucking rabbits. As if world needs more population. This is related
            with human nature. It is not hard to understand why people are
            programmed into breeding. It is funny how majority of people think
            humans are not animals, we are something better. Yet almost every
            human action are highly instinctive. We only think they are
            conscious actions because human behaviours evoled into something
            pretty complicated. But if you look deeply into them you can see
            that they all are products of primitive animal instincts. All human
            actions are based on surviving and fucking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could talk about overpopulation forever but i want to talk about
            something else, something that concerns me the most. Coping with
            mediocrity in this massive human inflation. Think about it for a
            second. Doesn't matter what you do there is almost always someone
            better than you. Doesn't matter how hard you try there are millions
            of people trying harder than you. You are not special. You are
            mediocre, a normie, a pleb, useless peice of shit. Just like anybody
            else. Even if you are so damn blessed with great genetics world
            population is so large there are probably millions of people like
            you. Even if you tried so hard to obtain hardest to obtain skills,
            there are probably hundreds of thousands of people done it before
            you and probably market is already full of those skillful bastards.
            You are a great artist or an athlete? You need crapload of luck to
            be successful, because guess what? There are millions of super
            talented artists who cannot pay their bills. You want to be an
            olympic athlete? Well, too bad your parents did not give you the
            genetics of top 0.00000000001%, because you need to be best of the
            best. You need to be a freak of nature to succeed in any
            proffesional sport. Being perfectionist in these days is impossible.
            If you say you are a perfectionist you either don't know what
            perfect is or you are a wannabe perfectionist trying to fool
            recruiters when looking for a job. Perfectionism is huge waste of
            time. You will never be perfect. You will never be the best of the
            world because you both need to be lucky and a hard worker. You need
            to dedicate your entire life for a single thing.
          </p>
          <h2>HOW TO DEAL WITH MEDIOCRITY</h2>
          <p>
            Ok, maybe i was too pessimistic. When it comes to art and sports
            yes, you need one hell of a luck. You need to born with the right
            tools and you need even more luck to be discovered. There is no
            escape from luck, everything is related with it. If you are trying
            to be the best, it is gonna be a nightmare for you. But good thing
            is, you don't need to be perfect. Majority of humans doesn't give
            any effort for many stuff. With some effort you can be better than
            most people. A mediocre pilot is mediocre when you compare them with
            rest of the pilots, but when you compare them with rest of the world
            you can see they are still better than most when it comes to flying
            a plane. How many people can fly a plane for fucks sake? With tiny
            bit of effort you could learn some basic electronics and could be
            better than most people in that stuff because most people doesn't
            even know what the hell is a soldering iron. Yes human population is
            so vastly but good news is very little of them are passionate about
            doing something great with their lives or even learning. I don't
            judge people, it doesn't matter what you do with your life at the
            end of the day. A mediocre life can make you happy for sure. I
            personally wouldn't compain about a mediocre salary in a real
            fucking job. But if you can withstand some ass pain you will get
            rewarded for sure. Whether your talent sells or not.
