        <h1>GHOSTS FROM MY PAST ARE HAUNTING ME</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Depression has some weird effects on your dreams. I had wildest
            nightmares and dreams of my life in my last few years. I most
            commonly see my old friends i lost the contact with in my dreams.
            And even if it is not a nightmare it makes me feel weird. In my
            childhood we were constantly moving, changing adresses and even
            changing cities every once in a while. Therefore i needed to say
            goodbye to many of my old friends. I met with a lot of different
            people. I had some good friendships and some horrible ones like
            anybody else. I can definitely say you meet with your best friends
            when you are at your absolute lowest. When i was living in a
            horrible little town with a lot of hostile people, i met with a lot
            of great friends, we were taking care of each other. I was in middle
            school at the moment. But as time passes by my friends were moving
            one by one. Eventually i ended up becoming best friends with the
            last remaining friend of mine. We were like minded kids at the
            moment. We did not lose contact even after we moved into different
            cities. But nobody remains same. Eventually he ghosted me after
            arguing over politics and religion. We did not hurt each other with
            mean words or anything. We were casually arguing. I was even super
            kind to him. It is unbelievable how a person you used to talk about
            childish stuff ends up being a radical extremist. Shortly after he
            learned that i am a filthy heretic he ended up ghosting me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years later, i casually see him in my dreams every once in a while.
            I probably saw him at least 15 times before. Everytime in a
            different place. But context is the same. He comes up from nowhere.
            Opens his arms, greets me with a smiling face. We hug each other. We
            talk about random stuff. He tells me that past is past and we are
            friends again. Then i wake up in the middle of a night with that
            weird feeling. And i stay awake all night thinking about my past.
            Thinking about what my old friends are doing now. I don't use any
            social media, i literally have no idea what my old friends are doing
            or where they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes i get most unexpected visitors in my dreams. Like my
            primary school friend. Primary school memories are very patchy and
            obscure for me. Shortly after i finished primary school we moved.
            Into other side of the country, quite literally. She visited me in
            my dream a couple years ago. When i was in a horrible mood and when
            i was quite lonely. I saw this dream about a year after i graduated
            from highschool. In my dream I was in a highschool, waiting for
            someone. The sky was cloudy and gray. It was almost night time. Kids
            were leaving one by one. Just when I thought everyone has left the
            entrance, i saw her. She was't the little girl i remember. She was
            an adult, but also i could recognize the every detail of her face.
            It is weird how clear her face was despite not having clear memories
            from my childhood. And seeing her as an adult was even weirder. How
            my brain aged her with this much precision is beyond me but anyways.
            After she saw me her pupils has grown. She was as surprised as me.
            She called my name and it was that moment i realised the bruises all
            over her face. It was almost like she has been beaten so badly. I
            asked what happened. Her attitude changed so fast. She said
            "nothing" and started to walk away. I followed her to the outside.
            Grabbed her by the arm. She turned her face towards me. She was
            crying and i can never forget that face. She was looking so
            desperate. I asked who did this. She refused to answer "You cannot
            help with that, please leave me alone" she said while sobbing. Sky
            was almost dark at that moment and school was empty. After that i
            woke up without being able to learn what happened to her. That dream
            fucked me up for a long while. I had some really wild dreams, but no
            dream i have ever seen in my life affected me this much. After that
            wild dream i tried to contact with her, tried to look for her on
            facebook, instagram and even twitter. I tried to google her name but
            had no luck. Still today i don't know where she is or what she is
            doing. Last time i contacted with her was via facebook when i was in
            middle school. This was long after i finsihed primary school. She
            told me that she had a crush on me. And told me that she has been
            changed a lot. Unfortunately i lost the contact with her once again.
            My facebook account was stolen by an asshole friend at the time. I
            gained my access back but forgot my new and complicated password.
            And this is how i lost the contact with her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last dream i saw was a quite normal one but made me feel weird
            nonetheless. I was back in highschool. We are getting freed from
            school. It is friday. Sun is beating down beautifully. I am with my
            highschool friends, i remember all the faces. We just finished an
            exam and leaving the school. Best feeling in the world. People are
            asking about how was the exam. Making jokes, talking to each other
            about some mundane stuff. We are walking together. I am thinking
            about the weekend and all the fun stuff i am gonna do (mostly
            playing videogames and watching youtube). Everything feels so real,
            i totally forget about i already graduated from highschool and spent
            my last 4-5 years without much human interaction. I forget about i
            am totally alone, struggling to keep my sanity, and being a total
            fucking loser. Reality hits me in the face after i wake up in my
            room in the middle of a night in almost total darkness. I am totally
            alone. And i realise i totally wasted my last few years. Most
            precious years of my life.
