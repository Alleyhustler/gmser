        <h1>YOUTUBE IS GETTING WORSE THAN TV</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            TV is garbage in almost every single country. Anytime I see someting
            on TV I want to fuck myself to death. I used to think that youtube
            and other streaming services are gonna replace the TV altogether.
            This might be true but it is not gonna be better this way because
            this garbage platform is getting worse and worse each day. Even
            complaining about youtube started to become boring but I will talk
            about this anyways.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, I know that youtube is allowed to do wahtever the fuck
            they want with their platform and we cannot do anything about it.
            Everyone complains about their bullshit but they keep using it
            anyways because guess fucking what? They have became a monopoly.
            Sure there are crapload of other video streaming websites out there,
            but if you cannot find whatever you are looking for in there what
            can you do about it?
          </p>
          <h2>FREE CANCER</h2>
          <p>
            I won't complain so much about the cringe you can find on youtube
            because it is not as bad as it used to be. I remember a couple years
            ago you could not fucking watch youtube without getting flooded with
            all types of cancer. Nowadays algorithm seems to understand what
            people want and they feed you with your favorite type of content so
            you can waste more time watching them. That being said, there are
            still crapload of cancer on youtube because people fucking love it
            and youtube makes money this way. Maybe you don't get eyefucked by
            them because algorithm seems to understand what do you like better
            but people just cannot fucking stop talking about this type of
            garbage. Just stop promoting them for fucks sake.
          </p>
          <h2>GOTTA MAKE ADVERTISERS HAPPY</h2>
          <p>
            Another thing youtubers loves to complain about is how youtube
            demonetizing their content or worse deleting them. They have every
            right to complain about this and it is total bullshit. I can
            understand the demonetization because youtube needs to make money.
            And you cannot blame advertisers for not putting their ads on
            certain types of videos. But the bullshit I cannot accept is how
            youtube screws up those videos that doesn't make any money for them.
            They are getting fucked by the algorithm most of the time or worse
            youtube just removes them. And majority of those videos are not
            harmful things. But videos promoting to do bunch of dumb shit that
            can possibly put you in danger are getting millions of views. Some
            of these videos are trageted for children even. But noo, real danger
            is a guy who reads some reddit comments or people talking about
            sligtly controversial things. And getting your channel demonetized
            is so easy, only thing you need to do is using a little profanity.
            What is this bullshit? Even TV allows it nowadays. Youtube is slowly
            but surely turning into a kindergarten. And no need to say that your
            video can get wiped out for no fucking reason and youtube staff can
            simply tell you to fuck off. This shit is even more sinister in 2nd
            and 3rd world countries but nobody knows about it. They can remove
            your video just because of political reasons or simply because bunch
            of religious cunts did not like it. Gotta make majority of people
            happy, you wouldn't want to get your website cancelled by a nation
            that is being ruled by a bloody dictator.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the same fucking reason we cannot see dislikes anymore. Fuck off
            with that bullshit "We Do It tO PrOtEcT PeOpLe". You do it to
            protect your wallet. Youtubers can just remove likes and dislikes.
            This was a thing for years. But what you did was shitting on
            channels that removed likes, dislikes and comments. They could not
            get as many views if they remove dislikes so most youtubers just
            kept them open. And with this new brilliant solution, only person
            that can see the dislikes is the very same youtubers you are trying
            to "protect" from harassment.
          </p>
          <h2>BROADCAST YOURSELF(AS MUCH AS WE ALLOW)</h2>
          <p>
            I guess I already talked about this but I need to say a couple more
            things. Do you know how easy it is to fool youtube's algorithm and
            copyright claim music that you don't even own? There are people
            making millions of dollars this way. All because they need to make
            DMCA happy so they need radical solutions. Because robots sure can
            tell if there is a copyright infringement. As long as music
            compaines doesn't get hurt it is ok to screw up millions of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            False copyright claims and youtube's retarded algorithm is something
            everyone knows and tired of. But there are more sinsiter things it
            does. They just remove millions of videos simply because they are
            not very appealing for them. Half of my playlists on youtube are now
            empty. Youtube simply doesn't allow certain types of opinions. As I
            mentioned it is even worse in 2nd and 3rd world countries. I myself
            has seen people simply talking about philosophy, religion and maybe
            some politics getting nuked because it doesn't appeal to majority of
            my country. And if there is one thing Youtube likes is to suck
            dicks. Sucking dicks that is gonna bring more money. Twitter is even
            worse but luckily I don't give shit about that cesspool.
          </p>
          <h2>YOUTUBE ALTERNATIVES</h2>
          <p>
            Youtube is gonna die one day(hopefully) or gonna share the same fate
            with facebook. It is gonna be a wastelend full of boomers. But what
            are the alternatives? There aren't any yet. But there are some
            candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most promising one is the LBRY/Odysee. It is a really
            interesting project and it is truly censorproof. Odysee is a
            frontend for LBRY network. It can get censored by maintainers and
            governments but you can always use the app. It is decenteralized and
            using the blockchain technology. You can self host your videos. You
            can also earn money simply by watching videos and donate that money
            to the channels you like. There are already many mainstream youtube
            channels on LBRY. It is so easy to move your youtube channel. Part
            of the reason why it has a great chance of being a youtube killer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another one is Bitchute but I don't think it is gonna replace the
            youtube. It is just so full of political content for now, there is
            not much else to watch. It is great if you enjoy watching Alex Jones
            I guess. I personally like listening to batshit crazy people and
            their bullshit. Very entertaining. Still, it is a great project and
            already has a niche audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            And lastly, there is a project called Peertube. I did not use it yet
            and it is not even remotely popular. But it is decentralized just
            like LBRY and censorproof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course there are websites like vimeo and dailymotion but lets be
            real, even if they become as popular as youtube there is no
            guarantee they are not gonna be as greedy as google and start
            screwing up people for more profit. I just hope that one day a
            decentralized video streaming service is gonna surpass the youtube
            and gonna bring back the golden age of video sharing.

        <article>
          <p>
            I just have no words to say. It is like time is fucking with me. I
            did not understand how fast a week has passed. I was having a hard
            time sleeping. Specially with the assholes living upstairs. I kid
            you not sometimes I feel like I live in a jungle. What kind of
            asshole would make noise at 1am? And not just a regular noise,
            fuckers have 3 kids at least and they are terrorizing the entire
            apartment. Did you ever wake up with a loud noise and thought there
            is an earthquake out there but realized it is just bunch of
            braindead shitters jumping around? What's up with retarded people
            and making way too many children? The amount of children they cannot
            take care of. We are destroying our civilization by allowing
            everyone to make children. Fucking shitters did not allow me to
            sleep for an entire week. And their stupid mom just loves to throw
            stuff out of their window. And it usually lands in front of my
            window. Like it is not enough annoyance they give. And the big
            motherfucker of the house, the father just loves making noise with a
            drill. Every week, 3-4 times. Do you have a fucking workshop in
            there? Anyways, enough complaining. I will end this long ass post
            here. I hope you all having a nice day.
