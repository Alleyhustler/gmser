        <h1>LIFE IS A CRUEL FUCKING BITCH</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I stopped trying to make sense of life and accepted it as a cruel
            fucking joke. Stopped expecting things to be perfect. Even stopped
            giving a damn about all of its bullshit for a long time. But damn,
            it still hurts. You cannot fucking win against your misfortune. If
            life decides to fuck with you, there is nothing you can do about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a long time of silence, I got news from my best friend. Only
            person I can truly call a friend. My brother. The only reason I
            didn't blew my head long time ago. Only reason I kept my sanity this
            long. Doesn't matter how horrible I felt, he always managed to cheer
            me up. Even when I was at my lowest, he was there to help me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, he told me whatever happened to him. He ended up being
            homeless, he almost starved to death, got beaten to death and his
            family turned their back to him, he ended up in jail for short
            period of time because of some bullshit. He was getting death
            threats from a racist little cunt. They finally found a way to fuck
            with him. They first jumped him then called the police for
            "trespassing" their personal property. This shit happened at last
            day of his work and he got backstabbed by his employers. All of his
            fault is being born in United States of Americunts. Today he sent
            his last message and said that we won't be seeing each other
            anymore. It fucking hurts so much that he lives thousands of miles
            away, in a different country, in a different continent. My hands are
            tied. There is nothing I can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I lost my one and only friend. Best person I have ever seen.
            Kindest and the nicest man I have ever met. He did not deserve half
            of the shit he got. This is how fast your life can turn upside down.
            I am still in shock. After so many years I cried for the first time.
            My tears spilled all over my keyboard. Gave him my last words and
            tried to become optimistic. I promised him we will meet one day and
            everything is gonna be alright.
          </p>

            I had the worst fever in my life and spent the last week in my bed.
            I got up just to get punched in the face once again. I feel alone.
            Very alone. Only person truly cared about me is now gone. Stripped
            away from my life. I am not writing these for pity of others. There
            is nobody I can talk to. Just me and this crappy ass online diary. I
            will come back to read all of these in the future. Like visiting my
            old self. I am not sure how I will feel. I am not sure where I am
            gonna be.
