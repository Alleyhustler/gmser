        <h1>WINDOWS IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE!</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            This piece of code dumpster called Windows gave me cancer. I had
            tons of problems with Linux in the past but i always could solve it
            with magic of command line in no time. If windows throws you bunch
            of problems you are totally fucked. Sometimes there is no fucking
            way to fix it. And you won't get much help either. Linux forums are
            super helpful and technical as long as they are not populated by
            neckbeards. But if you are trying to fix problems with your windows
            machine you get two suggestions. "DiD YoU TrY UpDaTiNg YoUr
            DriVeRs?" and "TrY To ReiNsTaLl WiNdOwS". Wow, thank you man. I
            could set my computer on fire with gasoline and throw it away and
            that would solve my problem too. It is not like I need to recover my
            data or anything. I cannot boot the damn thing and solutions they
            offer is to update my drivers. Damn thing cannot even boot into
            command prompt. At worst case with Linux you have your black screen
            and you can fix your problem using it even if you screwed up your
            desktop environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me talk about what happened. I got my new external hard drive
            and I was about to backup my data. The moment I tried to open my
            windows pc (I use two, one is a windows machine) and I got greeted
            with black screen. I restarted 5 times in a row best I could get is
            a frozen desktop with no wallpaper and icons. I couldn't do anything
            with it. Windows hit me with a message like "Windows doesn't
            respond!" Whole damn thing doesn't work. And it took me 15 minutes
            to boot up into desktop. Luckily I had a usb drive with a linux iso.
            I booted it up in seconds and now i am trying to recover my data. I
            guess my HDD is also giving its dying breath. I was about to write
            800gb of data into my external and halfway through i cancelled it
            since it takes unusally long time. Then i tried to unmount my drive
            but it threw me an error. I unplugged it and I realised I fucked
            everything up at that point. I couldn't mount it back so i
            reformatted it and started all over again. I did not sleep all night
            and I still wait for that damn drive to write all my data so I can
            get rid of windows and install linux mint. Judge me as much as you
            want, after dealing with all this crap I won't fucking bother
            installing a neckbeard oriented linux distro. Linux Mint seems
            pretty nice, I will give it a try. I already have crapload of driver
            problems with my other pc thanks to Nvidia being a total dick, a non
            user friendly linux distro is the last thing i wanna put into my pc.
            <br />
            P.S.: I just realized my seagate external HDD is a fucking garbage,
            it is slow as fuck if you are trying to write lots of files. I think
            there is nothing wrong with my internal HDD. Windows just being
            windows. Why in the goddamn fuck I need to reinstall this garbage
            every year? It works fine when I first install it then it becomes
            unusable again. I am sick of turning on my pc in fear.

            I guess I said all I wanted to say today. I was dealing with this
            shit since I woke up. What a fucking coincidence windows wanted to
            fail the moment I wanted to backup my data. Bill Gates must be
            fucking with me.
