        <article>
          <p>
            I wil go full boomer today. Why the hell no electronic device I use
            works properly? Maybe I can blame my crappy laptop and low end
            smartphone for this but no software I use works painlessly either.
            It is great I want to work on IT right? It just seems nothing made
            to last these days. And no, complexity cannot be the only problem.
            Fuckers build these things to fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            My laptop for example. Ahh, this piece of shit gave me so much
            headache. I cannot dual boot thanks to its "safety features". It
            literally doesn't allow it. Thankfully though, I got rid of that
            garbage called windows and started using only linux on all my
            computers. Linux is a headache all by itself but at least it is
            reliable once you solve all the driver problems. My disk is another
            big headache. I have an SSD on my hand but cannot just put it inside
            my laptop because this garbage doesn't recognize it. A bios update
            could solve the problem but I don't have time for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            My android phone literally got fucked after an update. Fucking
            thanks for the new theme google. I sure couldn't live without all
            your fancy animations. I wanted to get rid off all the google
            services and install a degoogled android but It is so slow, it takes
            ages for me to get into root menu. I finally gave up and now trying
            to use it as it is. And even if I dump crapload of money on an apple
            phone, situation is the same. They fuck up your phone with tons of
            bloat in every update. I miss the good old days of Windows XP and
            breaking up my pc everyday with viruses. I swear I prefer viruses
            over all these useless updates.

          <p>
            I feel slightly better today. Did not do much other than writing a
            couple articles and reading some news. For the first time after
            weeks I got some fresh air. Stepped outside my house for a short
            while. Why I do this to myself? I probably feel miserable mostly
            because I live a prison life. I am gonna go outside more and
            probably start lifting again. Day is not over for me. I will read a
            couple things before I sleep. I hope you are having a much better
            day. Whoever is reading this.
