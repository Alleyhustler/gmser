        <h1>FALLING INTO THE ABYSS OF THE MIND</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            It's been a long time since I lost myself in the endless corridors
            of my brain. Human mind is a marvelous thing. When it cannot cope
            with your reality it pulls you into another dimension. A dimension
            not only of sight and sound but of mind, a journey into a wondrous
            land whose boundaries are that of imagination. You are dreaming but
            wide awake. You feel joy, misery, pain, anger but none of that is
            real. It only exists in your mind, a wonderland of your own. A
            wonderland that is circling around you. You are the protagonist this
            time instead of being a useless detail in another person's world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your body catches up to your mind as well. You cannot stand still.
            You are wondering around, punching an invisible man, playing an
            invisible guitar, fighting against monsters that doesn't exist,
            swinging a sword made out of thin air. All of your senses tells you
            that none of this is real but your mind doesn't care. Your mind and
            soul already broke the walls of your physical body and launched
            through the space. You left the stratosphere, even the entire solar
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            You drop down to your bed after the day long adventure. The peace
            holds you in her arms and removes the filth of entire world out of
            you. She takes away that weight you were holding on your chest your
            entire life. You can finally breathe. She sings you the sweetest
            lullabies your ears ever heard of. The world shrinks into size of a
            marble alongside your pain and misery. Your eyelids gets heavy and
            the quiet kicks in. You fall into sleep on top of clouds.
          </p>
          <p>
            But like every dream, it comes to an end. And the comeback really
            crushes your soul. The sky falls to the ground, the world shatters
            and a tsunami hits you. Snap back to reality, ope there goes
            gravity. Reality smashes you in the face and knocks you to the
            ground. You are asking to yourself "Why? Why I cannot make my own
            reality?". The finishing blow comes after you realize how long you
            have been down there.

            Its been a long time yet again. My ability of fucking my life up has
            no boundaries. Not a single thing has changed in my life except now
            I have a few online friends. I also started to write a novel but I
            am not happy with my writing skills at all. I feel like my
            vocabulary consits of few hundred words. I don't know why the hell I
            am torturing myself by trying to write something in a language I am
            not fluent with. I need to read a lot more. I don't even remember
            when was the last time I genuinely finished a book.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the time of year when the war season starts in the middle east
            huh? I guess you need to pick a side in every major event or
            everyone is your enemy. Would you like to go with bloodthirsty
            terrorists or war criminals? Why and how all people ended up being
            experts on politics all of a sudden? Wherever I look, I see shills.
            It is not even funny anymore. At some point I was trying to make fun
            of every bit of absurdity in this clown world but now it is just
            boring. I think most people can relate that there just too many bots
            and shills on the internet. I really don't understand why people in
            my country are so eager to pick a side in every single war. We have
            absolutely nothing to do with this shit. On one side there are
            radical islamist retards and commies who condone all the terrorist
            attacks on Israel. On the other side there are Ã¼ber sechular
            dissidents sucking on Jewish dick just because of their hatred of
            Arabs. You live in Turkey among all places for fucks sake. If you
            really wanna talk about tragedies, talk about the ones happening in
            your country.
