        <h1>I AM BACK (YET AGAIN)</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            It was a few days back, after the midnight. Must be at least 3 A.M.
            It was one of those days where I felt like shit. Have you ever felt
            like someone else is controlling your body? It is something hard to
            explain. I wasn't myself. I was using my computer, doing some
            useless shit in the hopes of forgetting my existence for a short
            while. After hours and hours of sitting on my ass doing basically
            nothing, I stood up to light a cigarette. Turned off the lights and
            opened up my window. There was a full moon outside, directly in
            front of me. Don't remember seeing the moon this big before. It was
            so shiny. It was almost like it is staring at me. If I squint my
            eyes I could vaguely see a face even. It was raining all day and the
            sky was a little cloudy. I could feel the cold and moist breeze on
            my face. It was so refreshing and beautiful. The after-rain smell,
            cold oxygen-rich air, bright full moon. I stared at moon for a
            while. I was thinking how the life would be without a giant space
            rock revolving around the world. Funny how I never imagined that in
            my life before. Certain calendars would never exist. Sky would be
            less interesting during the night. Americans couldn't boast about
            putting a flag on moon. Neil Armstrong wouldn't say that famous
            sentence "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for
            mankind". Maybe even certain species would not exist on earth.
            Culture would be a lot different for sure, plenty of ancient gods
            from ancient religions would not exist. Plenty of books, movies,
            poems written about moon would not exist. Maybe people would be a
            lot less interested in space as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I thought what if this would be the last moon I will ever see.
            What if moon magically disappears? Would we mourn for our shiny
            space rock? Would anyone care? Of course this would shock everyone
            because nothing disappears like that. But lets say aliens decided to
            buy our moon to put it into their planet's orbit and we really sold
            it to them. Would we regret? What would really change in our lives?
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I thought, what if I die today? Would I regret not being able
            to see the moon once again? I would for sure. What made me think
            this way at the moment I don't know. I did not think about missing
            my favorite food, my favorite music, my favorite movie, my family
            and friends but I thought about a giant space rock. Crazy how little
            we appreciate things like these. Billions of years ago a giant
            celestial object misses the earth therefore it doesn't remove a huge
            chunk of material from earth and moon never exists. We would be
            living in a totally different world. Maybe even humankind would
            never exist. Who knows?
          </p>
          <p>
            After all that thinking, I decided to take a picture. My stupid
            cellphone camera fucked everything up so I decided to edit the image
            but fucked it up even further and I ended up with this image below:
          </p>
          <img
            src="img/fullmoon.jpg"
            alt="full moon in dark sky"
            style="max-width: 85%; margin: 2em"
          />
          <p>
            I guess this is the part I am gonna talk about where the hell I've
            been all that time. At least 2 months without an update. Plenty of
            things happened but very few changed. My downfall gained a little
            momentum. My mom lost her mind and stayed in a psych ward for a
            couple weeks. Our family was about to break apart. I used
            antidepressants for a short while. I suppose to graduate this year
            but I guess I need to explain my parents that It ain't gonna happen.
            Tried to find a job but got rejected every single time. Gained a
            little more weight I suppose, I don't look at mirrors so I couldn't
            really know. My back pain is back and my smoking addiction is out of
            control. I did not want to complain about shit like this all the
            time, so I decided I better stop writing. I did not completely stop
            writing though. I was writing things time to time, I have a few
            essays in reserve and I will share them in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was thinking about ending my life for real this time. I have had
            enough. I was scared of talking about this before because even
            thinking about it turns my stomach upside down. The idea of a bullet
            piercing through my skull an leaving me lifeless on the ground
            creeps me out. What a sight that would be. And the regret that comes
            after the fail. The uncertainty of such action. Not even sure if
            .32ACP would be enough to end my misery. I put the gun inside my
            mouth before, unloaded. I can still taste the metal. Even dry firing
            the gun made me feel uneasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing is worse than death. Nothing. Even small things like looking
            at the sky and seeing all those bright stars and the moon, breathing
            in fresh air, hearing the sounds of birds in the morning, petting
            your cat, enjoying a meal, first coffee of the day, enjoying music
            are worth living for. Even if the sadness is the only feeling that
            has left inside you, it is better than not feeling at all. There is
            nothing that will be waiting for you after the death. What you get
            in this world is all you have. And life is pathetically short
            anyways. Better stick around for a little while to see what happens.
            What is the point of running towards death while death is coming to
            you already?

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 23 JUNE 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            My day started as usual. Woke up late in the evening. Spent plenty
            of time surfing the web and reading some news. Wasted some more time
            laying on my bed. After wasting half of the day like this, wanted to
            check this blog to see what's up. I realized that whenever I launch
            it on google chrome or any chromium based browser it doesn't look
            that right. Header is a few pixels off as well as some other
            elements. Wasted a long time to learn what's up with that because it
            works perfectly fine on firefox. Turns out retarded ass browser
            engine of chrome screws shit up for no reason. It is totally
            incostient as well. It works fine with certain screen sizes but then
            screws up again. There is always a few pixel gap between the border
            and the header for some reason. And since I almost forgot everything
            I learned about HTML/CSS it took me a while to come up with a fix. I
            know how to fix the problem now but did not fix it. I need to update
            every single html file on this website in order to fix it. So I said
            "screw it" and moved on. But working on this annoying little problem
            reminded me my love hate relatipnship with web development. So I
            started working on my web knowledge yet again. If I work hard I
            believe that I can get back on track in a few days. I guess we will
            see how this will turn out.
