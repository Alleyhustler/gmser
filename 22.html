            Is it just me or are we realy surrounded by robots? I swear everyday
            I see the same people with just different faces. They think the
            same, speak the same, they even use the same type of words. Makes me
            think we really live in a simulation. Or maybe I am just slowly
            losing my mind. Regardless of what people believe, what kind of
            political veiws they have, they all act like robots. There is always
            a mastermind behind them, they wait for this mastermind to update
            their software before they have any opinions. Every fucking day, I
            see the same fucking person, on tv, on internet, in real life. They
            all act like they are sharing the same brain.
          </p>
          <h2>WE ARE ORGANIC MACHINES</h2>
          <p>
            It shouldn't come as a surprise maybe. Humans are machines too. We
            have no free will, our minds are limited with our environment.
            Humans are so predictable and very easy to exploit. And they do
            exploit the fragile human mind every single day. We mastered the art
            of brainwashing. And we increased the level of communication between
            humans. With the flip of a switch you can update your brainless
            minons and make them act in a certain way.
          </p>
          <h2>WE ALREADY LOST THE BATTLE AGAINST ALGORITHMS</h2>
          <p>
            I maybe mentioned this countless times before. Internet turns people
            into mindless robots. Algorithms feed us the same type of bullshit
            we love to see. It creates an unbreakable cycle. "You get the
            information of the world with a single click" bullshit! Intenet is
            more cenosred than ever. You just get what algorithm feeds you with.
            It is fake and hollow. It is bisaed and fabricated. More and more
            communication we have, more and more we turn into robots. This is
            the future of mankind. Robots are controlling our future. We already
            lost the battle. I could talk more about this, but it wouldn't
            change anything. I just wanted to talk about what bothers me.

        <article>
          <p>
            It is too late to celebrate the new year I guess. It's 2022 already.
            I have gone for the longest time. I wasn't doing well for the last 1
            month but for the last 3-5 days I was really prodcutive. Launched my
            first real website and was learning about web development. It is
            kinda depressing what internet has evolved into specially when you
            are planning to become a web developer. I just stopped worrying
            about things I cannot change. Things are really shitty in the world
            and in my shithole country specifically. I am just trying to carry
            on. Suicidal thoughts were messing up with my brain again, it just
            seemed so appealing to take the easy way out. But I am not a pussy.
            I will try my best to save my ass and start a life off the grid. I
            am greeting you with this puny ass blog post after all those weeks
            without sharing anything. I will write more. I gained some pace and
            I won't let it go this time. I blame myself for my suffering. If I
            wasn't a lazy piece of shit, my life would be so different. But you
            know what they say, don't cry over spilt milk. Please value your
            time more than I did. You don't understand how valuable it is until
            your months turns into days and your years turns into weeks.
