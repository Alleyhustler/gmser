        <h1>LOST IN TIME AND SPACE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            How many people are aware of how big the universe is and how much
            time there is ahead of us? Most people know that universe is so huge
            and almost endless for small creatures like us. But i don't think
            most people have any concept of time and space. How can i say this?
            Because many of us acting like they are immortal or believes that
            one day humankind is gonna rule the entire galaxy or even universe.
            Most people even believe that the entire universe is made for us.
            With all of its size and all of its age that is far greater than
            entire human history. And almost everyone acting like they are
            special despite all this human infilation. Despite the fact that
            there are almost 8 billion people living in this planet. Everything
            revolves around them. They are the most worthy of all. They deserve
            the most. Many are racing each other to have some significance. Type
            of shit people do for 15 minutes of fame are sometimes disgusting
            and cringy. There is no way those people actually understand their
            online presence is not even gonna last 10 years. 10 years is a big
            stretch for most of those people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not gonna talk about how big the universe is and how little
            space we waste in this small piece of dust let alone the entire
            universe. Everyone with bare minimum amount of astronomy knowledge
            and some common fucking sense must know this. But somehow everyone
            disregards this knowledge like we still live in dark ages.
          </p>
          <h2>TIME IS GONNA EAT US ALL</h2>
          <p>
            Day will come every single human ever lived will be forgotten.
            Greatest evil, greatest good, biggest mind, most influencial person
            ever lived, you, me, your family members, everyone. If you are lucky
            your name will be remembered by your descendants and other living
            family members. If you are some sort of celebrity maybe your name is
            gonna live 50 years. If you are a really big celebrity maybe a
            couple hundred years. If you are a world renown person, maybe a
            president, king, a scientist with nobel prize, a famous artist or a
            writer maybe your name will be remembered for a 1000 years. If you
            are Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Jesus, Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan
            or equally famous historic figure your name might even survive
            hundreds of thousands of years. So far so good right? Well, not so
            far. How long you think names of everyone you know including those
            celebrities and historical figures survive? 500.000 years? 1 million
            years? 1 billion years? Well you can increase the number as much as
            you want i doubt it is gonna take more than 1 million years to every
            name in history to be erased from existence. Even 1 million years is
            such short period of time considering the lifetime of the universe.
            1 million might sound like an eternity but it is something like a
            second considering the age of the universe. We are just very short
            living creatures to understand what 1 million years actually means.
            I don't even think humanity is gonna survive that long. I don't even
            think human empire is gonna last 2000 years let alone a million.
            Even if a miracle happens and humans survive there is a good chance
            that future humans are gonna evolve into something completely
            different. I am not a biologist or an anthropologist, so whatever i
            say has no meaning. Maybe we won't genetically change. One might say
            natural selection doesn't work on humans anymore. Maybe they are
            correct. But humans are gonna change no matter what. Maybe in a good
            way maybe in a bad way. One thing is inevitable. Cultural change.
            Every single thing we talk about today, most of our moral values,
            shit we wear, shit we eat and drink, shit we laugh, shit that makes
            us sad. They all gonna be different. And if by any chance humanity
            evolves into something far greater than us, our era won't mean
            anything to them. They are gonna see us as bunch of cavemen. All
            people we know today are gonna be insignificant to them. Maybe the
            term "Homo Sapiens" is gonna be used as an insult in the future as
            we us term "Neanderthal" as an insult. Maybe we are gonna be nothing
            but laughstock for future people with all of our history, culture
            and moral values. And considering even universe has an ending it is
            not hard to guess no craeture will be able to withstand the big rip.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all that in mind, does anything we do actually matter? Even if
            you ensured your name is gonna live thousands more years than your
            biological presence does it matter if you are gonna be nothing but
            insect food after your death? Does it matter what people say about
            you if you don't exist anymore? It is hard to understand why people
            do all the shit they do for just publicity. "Do something that is
            gonna make your name last forever. Become a legend. Be immortal. You
            only die when you get forgotten." Bullshit, you die when you die. I
            came into a conclusion that it doesn't matter how people are gonna
            remember you. We are programmed into survival, every people wants to
            have a presence that is never gonna end. They either want to be
            immortal or want to be remembered forever. Everyone wants to leave a
            mark in history. Billions of people lived and died, very little are
            being remembered today. What makes people think they are gonna be
            remembered? We are all bunch of hairless monkeys lost in time and
            space.
