        <h1>DO I EVEN LIFT BRO?</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I am back to lifting again. After 6 months of lifting like a pussy
            and 6 months of being a couch potato I am back to lifting. I was
            working out for almost 8 years. Last few years were not my best in
            terms of lifting. I did not even touch weights 6 months straight. I
            am currently a land whale. Before I started to slack and totally
            stop lifting I was in a decent shape. Not super model type of look
            but i had shitton of muscle. I was so used to being the biggest guy
            in the gym. Prior to that I was bulky as hell. I looked like a sumo
            wrestler in his prime. I could lift really heavy but did not like
            how i look. It was that point i decided to lose weight. And i did.
            As i said i was in an ok shape. Then depression hit me. First I
            stopped lifting then I started to get fat.
          </p>
          <h2>DON'T WORRY ABOUT LOSING MUSCLE</h2>
          <p>
            If you are in a similar type of situation I want to give you a piece
            of advice. I used to be really obsessed with bodybuilding and at
            some point with powerlifting. I was so damn afraid of losing muscle.
            I couldn't diet properly. Whenever I started to diet I ended up
            gaining 10 pounds. Now i see how retarded I was. Muscle comes back.
            You shouldn't really worry about it. Don't eat like an animal in
            order to build muscle or never be afraid of diet. Don't get scared
            of cardio. I experienced it myself in the past. It's been times I
            totally stopped lifting and turned back. I always could recover and
            gain all my muscle mass back. I never stopped lifting this long
            though. You should not worry about situations like this either. I am
            not so upset about my shape because I know I can recover from this.
            As long as you have the knowledge and passion you can always fix it.
            It is not end of the world. No matter how much you fucked up your
            physique. I see a lot of people who are worrying about this, there
            were even some people suicided because of this. We lost many great
            professional athletes during the pandemic. I totally can understand
            it. Some people totally rely on sports in order to keep their
            sanity.
          </p>
          <h2>SIZE DOESN'T MATTER</h2>
          <p>
            As I said I was really obsessed with getting huge. Luckily I did not
            touch to steroids. But it would be a damn lie if I say I did not
            consider it. Now I don't care about size. All my goal is to get in a
            healthy shape and be athletic. I know many people have this sickness
            called "bigorexia" specially in the bodybuilding community. It is
            not about looking good, not about being strong. At that point it is
            all about hiding your insecurities. I don't feel ashamed to admit I
            have insecurities. I grew up in domestic violence and bullying.
            After I hit puberty I turned into a freak. Bodybuilding was
            everything for me. I could eat anything to get those proteins. I
            could poison myself with caffeine to be able to lift tiny bit more.
            But now I see this shit has no point. There is always a bigger fish.
            That doesn't mean i won't try my best to build as much muscle as i
            can and get as strong as i can. Because I am so damn sure no matter
            how hard I try I will newer look like gorilla in human form. I am
            into lifting enough to know my genetic potential is far from being
            perfect. If you are not a steroid freak you don't need to worry
            about getting too big. I am just happy to say I won't try some
            stupid shit in order to get huge or get jacked. And bodybuilding is
            not a lifestyle bro. You better get a life if you think like that.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 25 AUGUST 2021</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            It's been a week again and I did not post anything. But no worries,
            I will fix my mistake. As I said, I won't end this project until I
            done posting 90 entries. I was mostly thinking and planning my
            future in this period of time. And of course i was wasting my time.
            I got some bad news from my buddy. I am not gonna give details but
            his problems are my problems. If I hear bad news from him it ruins
            my entire day. Other than that I am happy to say I finally know my
            true passion. I want to travel. It takes money and time I know. But
            whatever, i will try my best to achieve this goal.
