        <h1>FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Learning about western culture definitely has changed my
            perspective. Ever since I learned english and started to get
            familiar with the lifestyle of western people, I started to
            empathize. As a person living in a 3rd world country, I can
            confidently say that your pain is far greater than ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever I see someone complaining on twitter about their 6 figure
            salary they earn by sitting on a desk all day, it always brings
            tears to my eyes. Or seeing people on instagram sharing
            inspirational quotes with a picture of starbucks mug and talking
            about how we all must destroy the system. This is obviously worse
            than slavery. Working? Are you serious? Is this gulag? Every person
            deserves to get paid equally without being forced to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or whenever I see someone complaining about getting fatshamed
            because of being morbidly obese and not being able to do regular
            everyday tasks because of that and receiving free healthcare,
            welfare and a personal assistant for wiping their asses, it makes me
            cry. I have seen kids dying because of various kinds of diseases
            because government doesn't give a crap in my country but that is
            nothing compared to your misery. If I was a writer, I would write a
            book that talks about your tragedy. No person in the world deserves
            that kind of mistreatment. This is literally worse than fucking
            genocide.
          </p>
          <p>
            How about all those poor women getting kink shamed just because they
            want to cheat on their husband with 10 men. All those sexist,
            misogynistic pieces of shit judging them for that. I believe in a
            society where no woman gets called a slut for getting her anus
            stretched beyond its limits by 10 guys and an octopus. Women getting
            brutally murdered on streets or children getting forcefully married
            with a 40yo pervert is nothing compared to getting kink shamed. I
            cannot understand how cruel men can be. It is her body her choice,
            you sexist fucking cunts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talking about women problems, how about not being able to get twice
            as much salary? Retiring early and getting paid vacations during
            pregnancy is not enough. I don't wan't to live in a world where
            women doesn't get paid twice as much as men. Also those filthy men
            should kneel on their knees and kiss their wives feet every year in
            women's day. Or better we should enslave all men and use them only
            for breeding purposes because a society without men is a billion
            times better.
          </p>
          <p>
            How about all those fascists and their free speech bullshit. It is
            not enough that we have safe zones in universities and crap. I
            envision a world where every place is a discrimination free safe
            zone. It should be illegal to speak anything outside of universally
            accepted ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't you hate when people get your pronouns wrong? How about
            getting misgendered? This is by far the biggest tragedy in the
            entire world. Forget about all the genocides and world wars. Forget
            about children dying out of hunger and definitely forget about
            countries getting bombed to the ground. I have seen women killing
            themselves for not being able to feed their children but even this
            is nothing compared to your problems. What kind of cruel world we
            are living in. We all should talk about this. In the year 2022,
            people are getting misgendered and even worse they try to talk to
            you without even asking your pronouns. I cannot put this into words.
            How dare you! If you don't think we should punish those who are
            misgendering people with death, you are worse than a neonazi. God
            forgive me for saying this word, you sir are a white cismale!
          </p>
          <p>
            And trans children not being able to recieve hormonal replacement
            theraphy? Absolutely unbelievable. Is this Nazi Germany or what? Who
            are you to say "A 7yo cannot get a hormonal replacement"?
          </p>
          <p>
            Teenagers killing themselves with drug overdose, people are
            commiting crimes just because their lives are boring or even joining
            into jihadist terrorist organizations, people are taking their lives
            because easy life has no purpose, getting sick of doing nothing and
            getting paid for that... You guys sure have bigger problems than
            anybody else in the world. You are the most opressed, most
            victimized, most mistreated people on earth. And even though we
            filthy 3rd world subhumans don't deserve, you know what is best for
            us. You open your arms to all those not equally oppressed minorities
            and bravely defend their rights for them. You are the saviours of
            mankind. Can you imagine what would happen to Libya or Iraq if
            western world would not bring any freedom to their countries? But I
            am concerned about you poor first world people. You seem to suffer
            from bigger problems. So, for your own good, maybe you should not
            bring anymore freedom to world and deal with your own problems.

        <article>
          <p>
            Nothing has changed since last time. It is midnight already, and I
            am awake. I don't know what the hell am I doing with my life
            anymore. You can see my frustration through my posts I guess. Sorry
            for all the typos and stuff. I am having a hard time keeping my
            sanity. I hope today's post was not so offensive. I will cringe
            reading many of the shit I wrote in the past but whatever. I am so
            full of people's bullshit as you can guess. I cannot reach into my
            friend for a long time and I hope he is doing fine. It feels
            horrible seeing my closest friends suffer and not being able to do
            anything. That's about it for today. Hope you are all doing fine. I
            don't recommend reading the shit I write and taking it seriously. If
            I would fully open myself up I would get all sorts of enemies.
