        <h1>3 STAGES OF LONELINESS</h1>
        <article>
          <h2>I. Isolation</h2>
          <p>
            First you start spending some time alone, you enjoy it. You were so
            full of people's bullshit. It feels like a paradise. You enjoy the
            peace and quiet. You spend time doing whatever you enjoy all by
            yourself. You maybe see some of your friends time to time but not
            for long. Only one you need in your life is yourself. You don't have
            time for mindless social activities after all. You can spend all
            your time for yourself and your self improvement. You can, but in
            reality all you do is to play video games, jerk off and watch some
            shit for sake of entertainment. At this stage you are not even aware
            of the disease growing deep inside you.
          </p>
          <h2>II. Disconnection</h2>
          <p>
            You lose your friends one by one. Either because you don't spend
            enough time with them or they move to somewhere else and you just
            don't put any effort into making new friends. It slowly bothers you
            that you cannot share your thoughts and emotions with others. You
            are so disconnected from society, whatever people are talking about
            is totally strange to you. You didn't see that new movie everyone
            watched, you don't recognize the newest celebrities, you don't care
            about the new trends, you have never listened to newest songs, you
            don't even know what is going on in the world. It is like there is a
            whole another world out there and there is no room for you. It's
            like they put you in a drug induced coma and you just woke up and
            have no idea what's up with the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loneliness starts to play its dirty tricks on you. You start talking
            to yourself and maybe your imaginary friends. You maybe get into
            writing a diary but not for so long. You slowly stop enjoying things
            you used to love. You don't have fun playing video games, watching
            movies or TV series. Your hobbies turns into chores because you
            realize you are not that good. Why even bother? You slowly give up
            on your dreams. Success doesn't mean anything to you. You just want
            to live your life happily and get the fuck out of this world in
            peace.
          </p>
          <h2>III. Downfall</h2>
          <p>
            You don't have any friends. You don't have anyone to talk to. You
            didn't leave your room for months maybe. You spent many years being
            alone and it is killing you inside. You didn't talk to anyone for so
            long when you open up your mouth you cannot even recognize your own
            voice. The world is so dark and strange to you. All you know about
            outer world is all you see on the internet. Your reality is
            shifting.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't even do anything with your life anymore. You wake up, eat,
            shit and go back to sleep. You spend most of your time laying on
            your bed. Nothing is fun anymore, you cannot even taste the food.
            You maybe got some really bad habits like smoking or drinking, maybe
            even got into hard drugs. You stopped giving a shit about how you
            look. Your health is not even your concern.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your social skills has vanished. You don't even know how to talk to
            people. Not because you are afraid of talking to people. You just
            don't know how to say things appropriately. You need social
            interaction so desperately, you attempt to talk to random strangers
            and realize how socially awkward you are and feel even more
            miserable.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have lost all your ties with reality. You are daydreaming all
            day. So much so that you even forget about your existence. Your
            dreams are so vivid you can feel, smell and see things that doesn't
            exist. You don't even know who you are anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have became so overly emotional even the smallest things can
            make you lose your shit. You get bothered by random comments on the
            internet. You are angered by stupidest things that is not even
            related to you and doesn't affect you in any way. You are so
            emotional, you can watch The Muppet Show and burst up in tears for
            no reason. You are crying yourself to sleep many nights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suicidal thoughts are messing up with your mind at this stage. You
            ended up being a misanthrope. You are outright disgusted by being a
            human being maybe. Everything has turned to shit. There is nothing
            left for you to enjoy in this world. Your mind is full of radical
            thoughts and maybe you are deep into existential crisis. Every time
            you open up your window all you think is if jumping out that window
            creates enough force to smash your skull into pieces
          </p>
          <p>
            You are suffering from chronic loneliness but you have been there so
            long you don't have any social skills anymore to fix that. You have
            descended into an animal. You have passed the point of no return.

        <article>
          <p>
            Yet another late night and I cannot sleep. The time is literally
            fucking with me. I cannot understand how last few weeks has vanished
            into nothingness. I spent all that time doing literally nothing but
            staring at walls in my tiny little room. I attempted to get back on
            track but anytime I try to put something into my thick skull,
            despair sits in. I then give up and go back to my bed and spend rest
            of the day doing nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think about my childhood a lot. For some weird reason I have
            random memories from when I was 2 years old. I remember our old
            house. I remember it so well I could draw a detailed floor plan of
            it. We moved from there when I was 6. I remember plenty of things
            from my childhood but having a hard time remembering the last 5
            years. How weird.
          </p>
          <hr style="color: rgb(255, 176, 0)" />
          <p>
            I fell asleep halfway through writing this. Now it is late in the
            afternoon. I saw some really weird dreams. For some weird reason I
            see dreams about being in the ocean in a large crusie ship time to
            time. It always ends up with a disaster. A large wave comes and
            snaps the ship into half or some shit like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my dream I was in a large cruise ship. I was in the bridge deck.
            We were in the middle of a storm. I could see waves twice as big as
            the gigantic ship itself. But for some weird reason the air was so
            clear. Not a single cloud. Just a warm afternoon. But the ocean was
            not as kind, she was trying her best to kill us. Ship was rocking
            side to side with a massive force. I was trying my best to hold onto
            my life. Just when I thought the ship is gonna capsize we have came
            across a pipeline in the middle of an ocean. The entire ocean was
            split in half by a couple pipes. They looked almost like oil pipes.
            But they were not under the water. They were just out there, sitting
            a couple inches above the water and disappearing in the horizon on
            both ends. The storm ended right that moment. And our captain
            started navigating the ship towards those pipes. We got so close I
            thought we are gonna hit them. But suddenly the pipes started
            moving. They grew gigantic metal arms and started surrounding the
            ship. I woke up right at that moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            What a fever dream it was. And the weirdest thing, I have seen so
            many nightmares like this, I was so calm during that storm. Everyone
            in the ship was losing their minds. I menaged to keep my calm for
            some reason. I know for sure I would lose my shit at that moment if
            that really happened because I am scared of deep oceans. There is
            something fucky with gigantic vessels as well. Every time I look at
            some massive cargo ship I get goosebumps.
