        <h1>THE BREAKING POINT</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            When I started this project the plan was to fix my life in 3 months.
            It's been more than 3 years now. I guess I am not so good at
            planning. I did not write a single post over the last 8 months and
            last few people who were reading my shit now probably forgot about
            this blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually when I come back after a long period with no update I talk
            about how worse everything got and how little has changed for me.
            Not this time though. Because in a few days I am leaving my country
            to see my beloved. We will start living together. I finally leave
            everything behind and start over. Not everyday people get a second
            chance in life. It feels like I totally reborn. After all those
            years of suffering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last 7-8 months were totally wild. I don't even know where to start.
            I was busy. Real busy. I probably changed 4-5 jobs at this point. I
            have a lot to say about wage slavery but I save most of it for my
            future blog posts. At certain points I was working 10-12 hours a
            day, 7 days a week all for a salary much less than a minimum wage in
            a 3rd world shithole such as mine. I have been treated like a piece
            of dirt, on top of all the shit I was going through. I got injured
            several times, albeit not something big. I was barely getting 3
            hours of sleep a day, for several months. I was eating so bad and
            working so hard that I lost 50 pounds in 1.5 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could probably sense my despair from the things I said in my
            previous posts. I was at the wit's end. I spent a solid month or two
            rotting in my room with severe depression. I was miserable before
            too, but at no point in my life I cried like a loser. But the pain
            was so immense that I couldn't help. I was waking up early in the
            morning for a walk at the park near my house, with a mind full of
            thoughts. I was trying my best to hide my tears. Whenever I talk to
            anybody, my voice was shaking. Anybody with eyes and ears could tell
            that I was a living, breathing corpse. I lost all hopes of seeing my
            girlfriend or having any future where I am not a deadbeat loser. I
            was crying myself to sleep every single night.
          </p>
          <p>
            I begged her to leave me, I have done every single mistake a man can
            do in a relationship. I begged her so many times to leave me. She
            did not give up on me. Even though I gave up on myself several
            times. At the lowest point of my life I was plotting a suicide. I
            stole a few bullets from my dad's drawer, as well as his Walther
            PPK. I planned everything. Even picked up a location. I was gonna
            end my life in the middle of nowhere, where nobody could reach up to
            save me. They would probably find my corpse after the maggots
            already finished eating halfway through my body.
          </p>
          <p>
            I broke her heart way too many times over the stupidest reasons. In
            one occasion I told her that I am gonna kill myself. She said that
            she will follow me if I do that. This was the end of all suicidal
            thoughts for me. I could never do that to her. Because I care about
            her life more than I care about my own.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then found myself a job to save up some money. Even though I knew
            that it would take me several years to save enough money for
            traveling. It was still better than doing nothing. At this point she
            told me that she is saving up money to see me as well. Said that if
            I cannot go to her, she will come to me. She was still working a
            minimum wage job and living with a friend of hers at this point. I
            could never imagine someone putting up so much effort for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things got much, much better for us two. I finally found a less
            insufferable job with better pay and she moved out to a bigger city.
            Around the same time I came in contact with my brother once again.
            He helped me financially. This made things much easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's been more than 2 weeks since I quit my last job and started
            preparing for my flight. I got rid of most of my belongings, all my
            old clothes, my books, emptied my drawers. And few days later, I
            will be holding her in my arms.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time period, I also discovered that I suffer from
            Borderline Personality Disorder. It explains so many things about
            me. It only became clear after I got into a relationship. I said so
            many nasty things to my beloved. One day she is the sweetest thing
            in the world for me, the other day she is the devil itself. I came
            very close to breaking up with her so many times. Luckily though she
            is actually the sweetest woman on earth, so that she forgave me all
            the time. It explains my wild mood swings, my impulsiveness and the
            superior talent of fucking up my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suspect that I have it because of an event happened early in my
            childhood. I don't even wanna talk about it. I will not give details
            but I got raped by a female relative of mine when I was 5 years old.
            It traumatized me so bad that, the whole thing was erased from my
            mind for solid 12 years. I suddenly remembered the whole thing one
            night.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I started reading about it, I realized how common cluster B
            personality disorders are. And how lame it is that BPD is mostly
            associated with bitches with daddy issues. The whole "feminine side"
            I thought I had was nothing but a mental disorder. But now that I
            know about it, I can learn to differentiate between intrusive BDP
            thoughts and reality. I heard there are certain therapies that
            helps. But I don't know where can I find a shrink who will not
            outright scam me.
          </p>
          <p>And just like this, a new chapter in my life has started.</p>
