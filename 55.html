        <h1>2008</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Among all those years, 2008 has a special place in my heart. Funny
            how 2008 was such a forgettable year for majority of people. Only
            thing notable about 2008 was that stupid mortgage crisis, or
            something like that. I cannot think of any special event from the
            year 2008. But for me personally, it was a fantastic year.
          </p>
          <p>
            31st of December 2007, new year's eve. By far my favorite new year's
            eve. I spent all night with a friend of mine. We spent all that time
            doing lots of fun stuff. Surfing the web, playing some flash games,
            playing board games, having chit chat, watching TV. Sounds like some
            boring ass shit I used to do everyday, but didn't feel like it at
            the time. We did not sleep all night and felt like shit in the
            morning but it was totally worth it. I got a gift from my mom that
            day, only gift I got from my mom in my entire life. It was a
            notebook. Ended up filling it up with lots of sketches and stuff I
            cut from magazines and newspapers. Always had notebooks like that
            after that point. I even won the lottery that year. It was a small
            amount, but who cares, it was crapload of money as a kid.
          </p>
          <p>
            And best of all, I got my first computer in the beginning of 2008.
            Not long after that we got internet. And my life has changed
            forever. I still remember the first day of having a computer. It was
            a total surprise. One day, after the school, mom came to pick me up,
            she told me dad bought me a computer. I rushed all the way home. And
            it was there, waiting for me. It was an absolute chonker. Big dark
            CRT monitor and a big dark ATX tower with an AMD Athlon 64. It had
            1gb of ram and came with Win XP. Also some pirated games including
            Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I couldn't sleep that night. Spent
            next few weeks absolutely hypnotized by the computer screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent a lot of time in internet cafes prior to getting my very own
            PC. I was confident that I knew everything about computers. I ended
            up screwing my PC a few times. Especially after plugging on the
            internet. Which was slow as shit. But that didn't prevent me from
            getting buttfucked by all sorts of early internet viruses. Even
            computer viruses were fun back then. They totally fucked up your pc
            in creative ways. Nowadays, viruses either steal your data or hog
            your resources for crypto mining. They don't throw you some messages
            telling you how big of an idiot you are, they are not freaking you
            out by opening and closing the CD tray, they are not changing your
            desktop wallpaper to some silly stuff. They run at the background
            and do some shady things.
          </p>
          <p>
            And early internet stuff messed up my adolescent brain. I remember
            the early years of youtube. You could find lots of porn even on
            youtube. I mostly spent my time playing games and googling most
            retarded shit one can imagine. I seriously thought Google was some
            sort of a god that can answer all of your questions. I even spent
            some time writing my very first blog without knowing shit about
            blogging. There was a blog hosting service long forgotten by now.
            One of those obscure ones. Everyone was into blogging and personal
            websites back then. I wish I could find my very first blog to get
            some of that cringe. I can find other websites I created later on.
            Including the one I created when I first learned about HTML and CSS.
            Didn't know crap about it but I was stealing any kind of HTML/CSS
            code I could find on the internet. Ended up with a website capable
            of burning your cornea.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I would have one chance of reliving a day in my life, I would
            choose the last day of 2007. Just a glimpse of that day is enough
            for me. I am certain I wouldn't have the same amount of fun I had
            when I was a kid but I still want to go back.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 24 OCTOBER 2024</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            A little late update maybe but it is not easy trying to adjust to a
            whole new place, new people, new house. I live on the other side of
            the planet now. First few weeks felt most like a dream, a good one.
            Everything here is so different. The culture, people, language,
            climate, time zone... I didn't get used to all of it yet, but I am
            halfway there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Picked up a few hobbies recently. Trying to make digital music. Made
            a few beats already. It is fun yet frustrating. Well, it was fun in
            the beginning at least, until I came across buttload of technical
            issues with DAWs I use. As usual, nothing works flawlessly on Linux.
            Specially things made for Windows. But I got used to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a little anxious because I totally spent all my money and I
            don't have a job yet. But at least we have pretty much everything we
            need in our house. Spent most of the money for furniture. It was a
            necessity. And I had tons of bad luck. I had to buy a bed 3 times.
            First one came with missing parts and couldn't get a refund. And
            second time, I went to IKEA, but their beds are made for people with
            no sex life. Shit literally fell apart into pieces in 2 days. I had
            to replace the inner frame with something more durable. And right at
            the same time our fridge got broken. Because my stupid ass thought
            it was a good idea to use a knife as an icepick to defrost the
            freezer. Anyways, long story short, besides the financial issues, my
            first month here was great.
          </p>
          <p>
            P.S.: My condolences for the Internet Archive. It was the saddest
            news I got this week. I hope it comes back fully intact. Archive was
            quite literally my favorite place on the web. If it vanishes so will
            the entire history of internet.
