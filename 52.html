        <h1>I WILL NEVER GIVE UP</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Nobody told me that love could hurt this much. In my previous post I
            talked about it. I am deeply in love with her. No words can explain.
            I forgot about all her past even though it gave me so much pain. I
            was even feeling guilty of things I cannot change or control. I
            blamed myself for not being in her life way earlier. I could suffer
            an eternity in hell if I could just start my life again being the
            one and only man who's been in her life. Oh my sweet princess, I
            would not leave you even if you were the most indecent, most
            horrible person in your previous life. If you end up reading all
            these in the future, I am so sorry for thinking the way I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was going through a lot lately. I was dealing with all these nasty
            thoughts and doubts in my mind and like it was not enough, she told
            me that she got Covid. It only gave me more agony. I wish I could
            suffer all her pain on her behalf for the rest of my life. At no
            point in my life I felt this desperate. Day after day I was crying
            myself to sleep. Being a failure now hurts 10 times more. She is now
            better but I cannot stop thinking what would I do if something
            happens to her. At certain point I lost all hope. I have found
            myself in the bottomless pit of despair. I thought, what if I can
            never make it? And then suicidal thoughts started chewing up on my
            flesh once again. Then I found myself looking at her pictures. I
            could not do this to her. I could never leave her alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every single day she kills me and brings me back to life. She put me
            through biggest joy and biggest pain I have ever had. If she is
            happy I am happy. If she is sad, I am sad. If she is in pain, I am
            in even bigger pain. She is my life, my passion and my religion. I
            care about her more than I care about myself. I will not give up on
            life, no matter how much pain it brings. I will work myself to death
            if that means I am gonna give my dying breath on her arms. I don't
            care how long it takes, we will meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now devoting every single breath I take to her. She is the
            whole purpose of my life. It is very well possible we will never
            meet but I won't give my dying breath in the guilt of not trying
            hard enough.

        <article>
          <p>
            I lost all my apetite, I wasn't sleeping well and I was in agonizing
            pain for a while. I also got erectile dysfunction but that's one of
            my least concerns. In only 10 days I lost 30 pounds of weight. I was
            in a miserable state of mind. Now, once again trying to quit smoking
            and caffeine because it only makes my anxiety even worse. Trying to
            get a full night's sleep, waking up early in the morning, walking
            outside, trying to hold on to whatever I can. I am now more hopeful
            than I was few weeks ago. I don't even care about the outcome, I
            will try my best. The internet has enough sad, depressed and
            miserable people. I want to be a success story. Fuck depression,
            fuck anxiety and fuck all forms of negativity. I cannot afford to be
            sad, depressed and anxious.
