        <article>
          <p>
            We are living in a strange era. Everyone can say anything just to
            oppose people they don't like. Hippes can be war mongers and
            conservatives can suck commie dick. Liberals can be fascists and
            religious nuts can shape into freedom fighters. Anyone can be
            anything at this point. Because if your enemy says something, it
            must be wrong and you must stand against it. This is how it works.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year 2022, people have finally gave a middle finger to
            evolution and went back to being spineless prehistoric reptiles. And
            it is very ironic they blame each other for being NPCs. Like someone
            is not pushing the buttons up high for them to act a certain way.
            Radical people never fail to amaze me. You are eating every piece of
            bullshit they feed you with and you call people robots. I am not
            talking about certain group of people. I am talking about all of
            them. They call themselves freethinkers and they believe it is their
            right to silence others just because "ThEy DiD ThE SaMe". They even
            use each other's arguments against the opposite side. I don't think
            in any part of history we have seen this much stupidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I probably should stop doomscrolling. It just makes me sick. You
            probably think that I am talking about recent events. Not at all,
            same type of bullshit happens everyday. Not only on a special
            occasion. Does any political ideology has any meaning anymore?
            Liberalism, communism, socialism, democracy, anarchy... They are
            some fancy terms people use to take cover. It is like choosing a
            class in a poorly made mmorpg. It doesn't make any difference. And
            the only political ideology in the world is populism. Sucking as
            many dicks as possible. You can say something today and do something
            totally opposite tomorrow. As long as people cheer you for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am talking pretty vague probably. But I think you got the point.
            Only thing I hate is the hypocrisy. Otherwise I don't give any shit
            about politics. It is so hard not to dive balls deep into it
            nowadays because everything must be political. Everything must be
            left or right, black or white. Conflict is the human nature I get
            it. But why common sense isn't? Isn't superior human intelligence
            the only reason we have dominated our planet?
