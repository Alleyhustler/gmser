        <h1>WAR DOES CHANGE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Its been a long time again. Every fucking day, I wake up with
            nightmares and spend rest of my time reading news and surfing the
            web. Shit is getting worse and worse and I am about to lose my
            sanity. Great thing about being born in a 3rd world shithole is, you
            see the hypocrisy all around the world. You can see the ugly face of
            "civilized" nations. Specially when nations all around you are
            ripping each other apart. You keep your eyes on wars happening all
            around the world because that shit can come and bite you in the ass
            one day. You see the worst of humanity. For about years I have been
            watching all sorts of war footage, on TV, on the internet and have
            seen all sorts of fucked up shit. People ripping a beating heart out
            of their enemies, blown up corpses, inhumane tortures, executions,
            decapitation... Nobody with a sane mind would want to see this kind
            of shit. But you just cannot help when that kind of shit is
            happening only a couple hundred miles away.
          </p>
          <p>
            War, war never changes... It does actually. Quite a lot. It gets
            uglier and uglier. It gets more cowardly and more sinister. It comes
            closer and closer... It is like a theatre playing in front of your
            eyes. People were destroying each other ever since the dawn of
            mankind. There is nothing new. Other than the amount of destructive
            power we possess and the power of media. Back in the early ages
            maybe war was a lot more brutal but was also a lot more heroic and
            straightforward. Being a good soldier actually mattered. Nowadays,
            heroism has died in the battlefield. Even being John Rambo cannot
            save you from a missile that has been launched from a drone or a
            landmine, or an ambush, or an ATGM coming at you. Or from a sniper
            that can hunt you down from 700m away. You have been in a wrong
            place at the wrong time? Bullets doesn't care about how big of a
            hero you are. Living and dying is only matter of luck and highly
            depends of whichever side you are fighting for. Not exactly like
            playing Call of Duty. If you die people talk about you for a couple
            days then you will be forgotten forever. We are living in an era
            where men doesn't win the war but the machines icluding the
            propaganda.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing that is very different than the dark ages, nations can
            use all of their manpower to fuel the warmachine ever since the
            French revolution. Back then most armies consisted of mercenaries.
            Nowadays nations can grind each other down to zero with all their
            manpower because government thinks you owe them your life. Specially
            if you are a man. Just because you born with a dick you need to
            suffer. You are a disposable tool. Just because a bloodthirsty idiot
            screwed up, you need to sacrifice your life to defend your nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe one day I will die in the battlefield too. I have been around
            soldiers ever since I was a kid because my father is a soldier. I
            have seen people killing themselves because they cannot take it. I
            have met with commandos talking about their fallen comrades. I have
            listened tons of similar stories from my dad. I have met with people
            living with a bullet inside their bodies. Some are getting poisoned
            by the lead because they cannot remove the bullet otherwise they are
            gonna die. I have seen stockpile of corpses getting moved on top of
            trucks. Its been times I woke up with sounds of helicopters and 
            artillery. Some places I used to visit as a kid has been destroyed by
            suicide bombers later on. One of my friends' father has been killed
            by a landmine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have seen some horrible nightmares. I have seen bombs falling to
            the ground and destroying everything in front of me. I have seen
            things I cannot put in words. Whenever I hear sirens or similar
            sounds I get anxious. Funny thing is, I feel like I am the only one
            worrying about things like this. For some weird reason I don't get
            scared of demons, boogiemen, paranormal activities like every other
            people do. Things that are freaking me out are wars, earthquakes,
            fires, hurricanes, nuclear disasters and terrorism. Either there is
            something fucked up with me or rest of the world.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 23 FEBRUARY 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Last couple months, I have been in the bottom of hell. I am so sick
            of people and their bullshit. I just wanna run away and live my life
            as a caveman. You probably can relate. Getting tortured by all the
            shit happening all around the world and seeing where this shit is
            heading towards. I am not even talking about the war in Ukraine. It
            can be resolved but there are some things that will never get
            better. Like mass retardation, global disasters, degeneration of an
            entire youth, poverty, overpopulation, violation of freedom,
            violation of privacy, getting fucked by government. I don't want to
            talk more and bring your mood down. Depression is contagious and I
            don't want you to catch it. Whoever is reading this. 5 other people
            maybe?
