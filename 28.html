            I am not here for fear mongering. I am not thinking that world is
            gonna end tomorrow. But situation in the world is pretty fucked
            right now. Global natural disasters, pandemic, financial crisis,
            riots and on top of that all the wars happening all around the world
            makes me think that god is having one hell of a fun. It is almost
            comically bad but world has seen a lot worse. You wouldn't want to
            live throughout 20th century. 2 global wars, Spanish Flu,
            Tuberculosis, great depression, cold war, global oil and mineral
            crisis, Chernobyl disaster, Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Cuban
            missile crisis, Vietnam war, Gulf wars, Chechen wars, Yugoslavian
            civil war and Srebrenica, Congo civil war and tons of other
            massacres and genocides happened in Africa, Tiananmen massacre.
            Overall most disgusting shit you can ever imagine. By far biggest
            disasters in human history happened in 20th century without a doubt.
            Imagine you open your eyes to the world in the year 1900 and lived
            at least 100 years and saw the world tearing itself apart. You
            definitely deserve a medal if you managed to survive that long
            specially if you have been in both world wars.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do believe we are in the verge of another global war. Hopefully it
            never happens but there is nothing wrong with preparing for the
            worst. I am not sure how you can prepare yourself for a nuclear war
            but we better get ready for another long lasting war betwwen the
            west and the east. Worst thing is, most people from this century are
            soft. We haven't seen all the shit people seen during the 20th
            century. The situation is pretty similar to WW1. People were using
            muskets, horses and swords a decade ago in war. Now you are afraid
            of bombs falling on top of you, machineguns turning you into a pile
            of dust, tanks breaking into the trenches. We have seen nuclear
            disasters but never seen a proper nuclear war.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the best case scenario, nothing happens and we suffer from a long
            lasting economic crisis. This is really the best we can expect. Of
            course this is gonna hit the 3rd and 2nd world countries a lot
            worse. No need to be stupidly optimistic. I can already see the
            world splitting apart. Either eastern block is gonna isolate
            themselves from rest of the world for a long time, or we will get a
            full blown war. Both situations are pretty fucked up. I am not balls
            deep into politics. So, my judgment is gonna be faulty. But even the
            most apolitic person in the world can see nothing good can come out
            of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if the worst happens and you get hit by a nuke and by a
            misfortune you survive, you don't have much time to kill yourself
            before you start shitting your guts out due to radiation sickness.

        <article>
          <p>
            Last couple days were really rough. Not only because political
            tension all around the world. I cannot see myself going anywhere in
            life. My whole life was a huge failure. I seriously considered
            killing myself. People think it takes balls to do that. But actually
            suicide is the most cowardly thing you can do. It takes no courage
            whatsoever. There are pain free ways to end yourself. I am not gonna
            talk about that to give any ideas. I now feel pretty ok. I am going
            easy on cigarettes. For last couple days my addiction went out of
            control. I could not even breathe. I was lighting up a ciggy once
            every 20 minutes. I won't complain too much. Everyone is distracted
            and scared. It is gonna be over, like everything else. We haven't
            seen the worst mother nature has to offer. End is near yes, but our
            generation won't see that. I think our species has solid 2000 years
            to live, optimistically speaking. Knowing that is important. It
            makes you give absolutely zero shit about trivial things in life.
            Making yourself a name, earning more money than you can ever spend,
            making children, becoming famous...
