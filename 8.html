        <h1>DYSTOPIA WE LIVE IN</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Talking about current state of world was always in my mind. I was
            eventually gonna share my opinions on this. Keep in mind that i am a
            young and stupid person. I don't have a big knowledge neither do i
            have many experience in life. I am gonna drop a massive blackpill
            and it is gonna be totally biased. You might disagree with many of
            the stuff i will talk about. But as i said, i am just dumping my
            brain diarrhea here. My opinions doesn't matter, neither any other
            opinion. It cringes me hard when people ask "What makes your opinion
            so important?". Nothing, they are just opinions. Free speech should
            not trigger people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will go full boomer and say people of 21st century doesn't leave
            their houses. Duh, like you did not know that. We already been
            degenerating over centuries since the first human discovered the
            agriculture. Firstly hunter gatherer population started to decrase
            then nomadic lifestyle. We were less mobile, people started to live
            and die without leaving wherever they live. Human biology started to
            change as well. Suddenly we didn't need to have really sharp eyes to
            see the danger or great athletic abilities to survive. All we needed
            was more intelligence. I even heard some scientists are seperating
            hunter-gatherers with modern human and call modern human homo
            sapiens sapiens. But I cannot find a source for this anymore. Maybe
            i don't remember correctly. As i said, when it comes to evolution i
            am pretty ignorant, take whatever i say with grain of salt. Lets
            look at modern human. Physical power has even less importance. We
            have every tools to keep people alive. Average human life expectancy
            is almost 80 years. We don't compete against other predators
            anymore, most of us at least. We compete against machines. And we
            compete against our last remaining primitive insticts. Your brain
            screams for violence, pushing you to strive for getting a higher
            place in food chain and spreading your genes widely. But society
            holds you back, you cannot act like a caveman. You cannot drink wine
            from skulls of your enemies or cannot have a harem full of women.
            Maybe this is for good. Human nature is so full of shit after all.
            We need to overcome human. We lack movement in our lives. We are
            safe from dangers of nature but we are more worried than ever. We
            are all anxious, angry and hateful. We have all the communication
            but we cannot communicate with each other. How the greatest
            revolutions in communication technologies ended up splitting us
            apart instead of getting us closer?
          </p>
          <h2>HOARDS OF NPCS</h2>
          <p>
            There was a 4chan thread i read some time ago. It was arguing that
            internet is dead and populated by bots. They call this phenomenon
            "Dead Internet Theory". Anon was claiming that everything we see
            started to repeat, masses of people were acting like robots as if
            they were being controlled from the same source. All the content,
            videos you see, some internet personalities, 4chan threads, reddit
            posts, tweets all looks like has been created by robots. Internet
            repeats itself. You see same arguments over and over. Similar type
            of people arguing the same thing. You see the same content with same
            comments everyday. Anon goes one step further and claims even the
            entire mass produced entertainment created by algorithms and entire
            internet is just fake and hollowed out. It was an interesting stuff
            althought it has some extreme claims. I don't think that bots took
            over the entire internet, rather people turned into bots. Even with
            all of its nonesense, it was a good read. It is not hard to believe
            that there are crapload of fake accounts and bots being used for
            luring masses into buying various bullshit. Social media is the most
            effective propaganda tool ever. There are several reasons why people
            are getting unified and organised in big or small groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is obvious that majority of internet traffic has been controlled
            by a handful of big tech companies. Average internet user spends
            most of their time on a few social media platform. This gives a
            really huge power to the mega corporations. Their "marvelous"
            algorithms are feeding people with the type of bullshit they like to
            see. I think this is one of the few reasons why people are getting
            radicalized. You are getting spoonfed with same type of content. And
            people who can exploit those algortihms can reach into your brain to
            plant their seeds. Other than that biggest search engine Google
            shows you altered search results. It is far from being organic. On
            top of getting lured into certain type of content over and over you
            also being manipulated by the big brother's himself. Twitter works
            the same way. Majority of twitter users has same type of mentality.
            It is pretty hard to find a different kind of opinion. Small group
            of people has the biggest influence over most twitter users. I won't
            talk about twitter much since i don't use twitter at all. I got
            enough cancer from twitter despite not using it. Youtube diligently
            hides various types of content from you. I whitnessed it myself.
            Some videos cannot be find using the search tool. And needless to
            say some content is constantly getting deleted. Or entire youtube
            channels are getting wiped out.
          </p>
          <h2>COLLECTIVE MIND</h2>
          <p>
            Internet makes it a lot easier to connect like minded people to each
            other. And thanks to certain amount of anonimty it offers, now every
            kind of idiot has a voice. You are sharing all sorts of information
            with your circle of people. You get the news from the same media
            corporations, you are worshipping the same influencers and at the
            end of the day you are using the same arguments. People getting the
            information from the same source ends up getting unified and turning
            into mindless robots. We killed the god and thought we are now free.
            But we ended up creating new ones. Religion has been replaced by
            politics. Prophets are now big media corporations. Biggest
            entertainment companies are owned by a single company. Everything is
            balls deep into politics. What they say is not important, you are
            gonna swallow it no matter what because everything is "Us vs them".
            You need to follow the pack because you don't have any personality.
            You need to hide behind bunch of big fancy words because you don't
            have your own opinions. You need to name people because that's the
            only way to avoid an argument. It is a lot easier than giving a
            valid answer because if i give you a name everything you say
            instantly becomes meaningless. Something new happened and you don't
            have opinions yet? Just sit and wait for your software update. Let
            the masters do the thinking for you. It is unbelievable how carrying
            a brain is a big chore for most people.
          </p>
          <h2>MASS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
          <p>
            You are constantly being watched. 10 years ago saying that would
            result with getting named as "paranoid" but everyone knows it now.
            But nobody cares. This is the way they feed you with the type of
            content you "need to see". It is getting creepy day by day. All the
            data that has been collected by multiple websites, applications or
            services are usually getting collected in the same pool. Algorithms
            knows you better than you know yourself. In China you are getting
            credited by your actions. All the cameras are watching your every
            movement, all the apps controlled by government feeding the machine
            with your personal information to determine how "good" of a citizen
            you are. After the China other governments are gonna follow the same
            path. In the land of the free you cannot take a shit without the
            government's eyes on you. Even having access to the all the data
            being collected in the country is not enough, they should make it
            easier for the government. They must destroy all the end to end
            encryption. You have something to say about it? You must be a
            terrorist, why would't you want to get spied on if you are not one?
            Do you think that all the privacy apps you use, your e-mail provider
            your vpn service saving you from almighty government? Think again.
            Your weed dealer might be your trustworthy FBI agent without you
            knowing it.
          </p>
          <h2>MODERN DAY DRUG: ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
          <p>
            Entertainment is not just a pastime activity, it is the meaning of
            life. It is only way of keeping your sanity in modern world.
            Everthing is source of entertainment. Nothing is serious. In 2020's
            we can make fun of everything, and can turn it into a form of
            entertainment. We are constantly getting brainfucked by shiny world
            of entertainment. We create new shiny worlds because we fucked up
            ours. And entertainment also must be easy to digest because we have
            15 minutes of attention span at most. We are always hungry for
            entertainment. We are falling for all sorts of fake accomplishment
            in virtual worlds. We are hypnotized, desensitized and emptied in
            the brain. Everything is perfectly engineered into stealing your
            attention and keeping you addicted. And great portion of our
            entertainment is like our fast food, mass produced, easy to get,
            easy to finish and has no nutrients. Entertainment always had a
            dirty side but difference is today we have more propaganda than
            ever, we have endless amount of entertainment we can get without any
            effort and they are almost forcefully fed into our brains. You
            cannot spend a day without hearing a reference to buttman vs
            crapman, you gotta watch it. And entertainment never been this
            cheesy and full of crap. Originality has died years ago. You
            gotta consume the same shit over and over. Want to watch a new
            movie? Which one would you like to watch? How about a totally crappy
            remake of your favorite movie? Or maybe a war movie about american
            heroes destroying nazis? Or the same superhero movie that comes up
            every year?
          </p>
          <h2>WE ARE ALL ATTENTION WHORES</h2>
          <p>
            There is nothing we can't do for some attention. We paint our faces
            to act like holocaust victims on tiktok, we show our asses in front
            of destroyed buildings, we are saving the world on twitter. We all
            sexually assaulted, we are all oppressed, we are all victims. We
            cannot live without posting a selfie every minute. We all have
            awesome sense of humor, if people doesn't like it they don't
            understand dark humor. How about throwing ourselves in front of
            trains, or shoving up a dynamite into our asses or drinking bleach
            or shooting ourselves in the cheek, fight club style? How about some
            drama? Lipsyncing in front of camera, photoshopping our asses, using
            faceapp to boost our ego, dressing up like anime characters for
            getting some upvotes from neckbeards, reposting the same shit over
            and over for getting approval of strangers...
          </p>
          <p>
            While we are busy doing dumb shit, technology is evolving and it is
            gonna catch us off guard. It is evolving faster than ever. I already
            created a huge mess today. I am gonna talk about that later. I hope
            you enjoyed reading.

        <article>
          <p>
            Not much to say today, specially after dumping that monstrosity. I
            was busy writing this since i woke up and yeah i woke up pretty late
            again. I don't know why I even wrote a huge article like this and
            expecting people to read it but it felt so damn good. I feel like i
            said 80% of the all things i wanted to say here. I will be awake at
            the rest of the day and probably gonna share another update.
