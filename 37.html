        <h1>LATE 1st YEAR ANNIVERSARY</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Its been 1 year and 5 days ever since I started this blog. I was
            planning to write something about this on 22nd of July but I was
            lost in my head. It is maybe too late but I am gonna say a couple
            things anyways.
          </p>
          <p>
            After more than 1 year I am still in the same phase. Nothing has
            changed in my life. 1 year is one hell of a time to change your
            life. But being a retard I am this never happened. I still go back
            to my old blog posts and read them time to time. I guess my writing
            has improved a little. As well as my English. I still feel like an
            idiot trying to speak it but I will never be as fluent in English as
            my native language. I accepted that fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't say much about myself, who am I or where I live because I
            didn't think anyone would care. I mostly do this for myself. I love
            dumping whatever inside my head into webpages. It is good to see
            there are a couple people reading the stuff I write with my broken
            English. This is all I wanted. I wanted to create an internet
            artifact hidden deep inside the ones and zeros of this massive
            information dumpster yard. Maybe decades later someone finds this
            mess I created while diving deep into the bottom of internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find it quite relaxing writing about stuff I was hiding inside my
            head for a long time. Things I was thinking about before falling
            into sleep. Total nonesense maybe, but my nonesense. I can read
            myself a lot better after going back to my old posts. What was going
            in my mind at the time, what made me think that way and whether I
            was wrong or not. Even though there are only a few people reading
            this shit, I love dumping whatever inside my head. By no means I
            think my opinions are important and should be shared by millions.
            After years of suffering from existential crisis, I came into
            conclusion that we are all very insignificant creatures as whole. I
            came into true realization of my place in this massive universe. And
            I made my peace with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its been times I talked about very depressing shit and my suicidal
            tendencies. I really didn't mean to. Life is good. Life is worth
            living with all of its absurdity, cruelty and meaninglessness. I
            tried to stay positive and talk about nice stuff but I wasn't in
            that mood most of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting this blog was the best decision I made in the last few
            years of my life. Writing has become one of my passions even though
            I suck at writing, specially in English. I have so much in my mind,
            so many stories I want to tell, so many ideas pushing the doors of
            my head to throw themselves out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing gave me an opportunity to understand myself. There are lots
            of stuff I am hesitant to talk about. Maybe in the future, if I can
            overcome my fears I will talk about them. But for now I want to
            thank those people reading this blog and giving me nice feedback.
            Thank you all for your kind comments and emotional support.
