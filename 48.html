        <h1>QUARTER-LIFE CRISIS</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Why it takes so long for humans to grow up? When a deer, giraffe or
            a goat is born, it starts to walk in matter of hours. The moment
            they open their eyes to the world, they stand up. Many animals in
            nature fully grow in matter of a couple years. They already know
            what to do, how to hunt, how to run away from predators, how to
            stick with the pack, what to eat and what not to eat in very early
            stages of their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you open your eyes to the world as a baby human, you are
            clueless. You are totally dysfunctional. It takes months if not
            years to learn how to walk. It takes many years to fully learn how
            to communicate. You put whatever you grab into your mouth as a baby.
            You do all sorts of stupid things that can end your life. You need
            parental guidance 24/7. You need someone to tell you what to do,
            what to eat, even how to take a shit. It takes 18 years to fully
            grow and become a part of society. Even after 18 many aren't ready,
            some of them stay as a manchild forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is that? Science has answers I bet. "Because our heads are too
            big for pelvic bones so we born highly underdeveloped" or something
            like that. But the problem is bigger. Even long after you develop a
            fully functioning brain, you are not ready for life. The moment you
            step into your early adult life, you feel like a fish on land. You
            were a tadpole swimming in a small pond your entire life and now you
            need to learn how to be a frog all by yourself. You need to leave
            your cozy little pond and throw yourself out into wilderness. You
            need to grow yourself a pair of legs and learn how to jump and learn
            how to catch flies.
          </p>
          <p>
            You waste your most valuable years in school. They feed you up with
            a lot of bullshit. They are trying to teach you a plethora of
            information full of unnecessary details but they fail to teach the
            very basics. You end up filling your head with useless details but
            you don't know shit about how things work. You memorize the periodic
            table but don't know how chemicals react with each other. They teach
            you the mechanics of ATP synthesis in human cells but you don't even
            know where the liver is located in human body. They teach you
            differential equations but you don't know what to do with that. You
            memorize all the ancient civilizations and their law but don't even
            know how your government works. They don't teach you where money
            comes from, how capitalism works, what are some of the most popular
            political ideologies and all other very necessary information to
            understand what the crap is going on in the world. They outright lie
            to you time to time. Purposefully designed lies. All that hassle is
            to shape you into a conformist little sheep. All in all you're just
            another brick in the wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if your family, friends or society doesn't educate you on very
            basics of socializing, how to behave, how to get a job, how to pay
            your bills, how to do paperwork, you are totally screwed. You are on
            your own. You don't know how to live a healthy life even. And when
            school or family doesn't guide young people, internet does. This is
            why we see all sorts of degeneracy and stupidity among younger Gen
            Z.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ask kids what they want to become in the future, the answer
            changes in every period of their lives. Younger they are, stupider
            the answer gets. A 6 yo would say "I want to become a superhero" or
            "an astronaut", "a president", "a cowboy", "I want to become Chuck
            Norris". Once they become teenagers the answer changes. It becomes
            something a little more sensible but still more often than not it is
            a big, fancy dream. They might say "I want to become a CEO" or "a
            successful surgeon", "next Bill Gates". Later in their teenage years
            they just want a job where they can make a lot of money with only a
            little effort. After they graduate from high school or college they
            waste a lot of time searching for their dream jobs and eventually
            settle down for being burger flippers. Very few aim for realistic
            goals and score those goals. Those are the lucky few on earth born
            in the right place, at the right time and with a lot of guidance.
            For rest of us, we end up being one-line actors in a script written
            by someone else.

        <article>
          <p>
            I made a habit of ignoring this website. I have disappointed some
            people, I see. I really didn't want to whine about my crappy ass
            life every single day for the last 4-5 months. I have been through
            hell ever since my last post. I am waking up with nightmares, my
            anxiety is out of this world, my hands are shaking constantly, I am
            losing my health day by day, having a hard time breathing because of
            my smoking habit, didn't talk to anyone for a long time and I lost
            all the feeling and emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am just numb all the time. Cannot feel angry, cannot feel happy,
            cannot feel sad. Just plain numbness. If they say the world is
            ending tomorrow, I probably wouldn't react to it. Everyday I read
            about all the horrible shit happening in my country and around the
            world but none of it sparks any response in my brain. Closest thing
            I get to a feeling are the anxiety attacks that kicks in usually
            during the night. I don't even remember when was the last time I
            took a good sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked in a factory as a manual labor for a short while during
            that time and let me tell you something. FUCK WAGESLAVERY! I was
            working from 7am to 5pm with only 1 hour of break time for lunch.
            They made me work like a goddamn machine. No resting, no stopping.
            And there was this bitch who is an overseer. Never seen such a
            disgusting human being in my life. If this bitch sees you taking a
            rest for a second, even if you don't have work at hand, she will
            yell at you. Only thing she is missing is a whip. She is the
            reincarnated 21st century form of Irma Grese. I even got yelled at
            by her because of her dumb ass not doing her job properly and
            telling me what to do. Why women with power always end up like this?
            And I have seen all sorts of low life scumbags picking up on other
            people for not working hard enough. It is like the prisoners of
            Auschwitz torturing their comrades for a slightly better treatment.
            I am still wondering what kind of social experiment I have been
            through. I quit that job after 2 months and went back to being a
            total failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am back to trying and failing to build myself a whole new
            career in IT. With the current state of tech industry and all the
            crap I need to deal with because of living in a country that's being
            ruled by absolute smoothbrained monkeys I am not even sure if it
            will work out. I was just doing 1 hour of work a day and spend rest
            of my time laying on my bed staring at the ceiling and thinking how
            the hell am I gonna save myself from this situation.
