        <h1>PIRACY IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Yes, piracy is not stealing, piracy is not evil in fact it is a
            basic human right in my opinion. Piracy is our saviour. Thanks to
            piracy, many games, movies, books has been survived to this day. If
            nobody would attempt to save retro games, all of them would be gone.
            Do you think game publishers actually give a damn about preserving
            their games? If piracy wasn't a thing many books could not see the
            sunlight and could easily get removed from existence. If there was
            no piracy, many people like me could not even have access to books
            and they could never educate themselves.
          </p>
          <h2>PIRACY IS NOT STEALING!</h2>
          <p>
            It is so damn ridiculous when people say you are committing a felony
            and you should be ashamed if you download illegal copies of books,
            articles, games, movies etc. If you steal, you are taking another
            persons rights from their hands. You give financial damage to
            people. No question, stealing is a felony and should stay illegal.
            But piracy is not the same. If you download a copied data illegally
            this does not affect people who bought them. You are only hurting
            some greedy publishers at worst case. If you are pirating something
            there is a good chance you cannot afford it. In this case, not even
            publishers lose something. You could not afford it to begin with.
            You get what you want, people who paid get what they wanted, creator
            of the product gets free publicity. Everybody is a winner.
          </p>
          <h2>INFORMATION SHOULD BE FREE!</h2>
          <p>
            Lets say you are a student. Your school wants you to buy a dozen of
            books. Those technical books are not cheap, let me tell you. At
            worst case you need to spend thousands of dollars for them. If you
            are one of the lucky few who born in a supporting family and they
            can afford it, no bigge. But if you were unlucky and born in a 3rd
            world country and you just cannot pay your yearly salary in order to
            buy some books. Well I guess they just expect you to die. How dare
            you ask for free information? If you want to study and get a job,
            you must pay! They don't give a shit how you suppose to pay that
            ridiculous price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok, maybe you can afford books and willing to work at local
            McDonald's for moths to pay for them. But, what if you are a
            resarcher and you need to read some articles for your study? Well,
            you better start lubricating your anus, because those greedy
            assholes are determined to stretch it. Do you know how much some of
            those articles cost? Maybe things are slightly better nowadays
            because you can just pay a monthly fee for millions of articles. But
            even that is just too expensive for people living in 2nd or 3rd
            world countries, which is majority of the world's population. And
            how much you think writers of those articles get? Publishers just
            steal their effort most of the time. So, you are not only getting
            robbed by paying for articles, but also supporting a filthy business
            model.
          </p>
          <h2>FILTHY ANTI-PIRACY ACTIONS</h2>
          <p>
            Maybe you still think piracy is totally wrong. Fine, I am not trying
            to convince anyone here. You do what you know best. But everyone
            should agree that companies are crossing the line most of the time
            in order to fight against piracy. It is annoying at best, nefarious
            at worst.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who the hell like DRMs? Everyone hates them. You just paid god knows
            how much for a movie, you plug it into your PC, and what is that?
            You cannot fucking watch it. Because that piece of shit only works
            in certain type of devices to protect against piracy. This is a
            thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are playing your favorite game but you lose your internet
            connection? Guess you won't be able to play it for a while. Because
            geniuses thought it would be a good idea to require internet
            connection for a single fucking player game! No need to mention they
            will probably shut down their servers in 3-5 years and their game
            will be erased from history forever. Imagine buying a game for 100
            bucks and EA goes like "He bought? Bois, shut down the servers."
          </p>
          <p>
            Do I need to mention DRM sometimes totally screws up and doesn't
            even let you get what you paid for? You cannot just copy a CD you
            just paid for. Do you still think you own things in 2022? Did
            capitalism just evolve into communism in disguise?
          </p>
          <p>
            But the most disgusting thing anti-piracy is ever caused was taking
            human lives. Yes, it happened. Do you remember Aaron Swartz?
            Co-founder of reddit. He took his own life because he was facing a
            long time in jail for illegally sharing scientific articles. Things
            that should not even cost money to begin with. Are they purposefully
            trying to create an ignorant and retarded generation? Why the hell
            research papers are costly?
          </p>
          <p>
            Aron was a hero and he will be remembered as a hero. He died in the
            hands of crooked politicans in order to fill the pockets of greedy
            publishers. He did not die, he has been murdered.
          </p>
          <h2>YOU CAN'T CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO GET</h2>
          <p>
            Most of the time paid services screws up their customers or they try
            to squeeze out more money from them. Maybe you pay for Hulu every
            month, you think you can enjoy your favorite tv series after a rough
            day, and what is that? That piece of shit throws a dozen of ads in
            front of you. Maybe you paid for Netflix for just one show you
            enjoy. And Netflix decided "Nope, lets just remove this show from
            certain countries, because fuck them!". You use spotify and you get
            flooded with total earrape? Guess what? Fuckers just pay for click
            farms and their crappy songs just appears on top. And spotify
            doesn't give a crap. More disgusting thing. Their editors has total
            tyranny and they can decide to screw up certain songs and promote
            others. This is how it works. You are getting screwed with your own
            money.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Amazon, oh god, imagine buying e-books form amazon. Amazon can
            just remove certain books from existence and they did this countless
            times before. They simply can remove a book you paid for from your
            library and get away with it. This is the modern day library arson
            very similar to what Nazis did during WW2.
          </p>
          <h2>ANTI-PIRACY KILLED THE ENTIRE INTERNET</h2>
          <p>
            Ever since the late 2000s retarded boomer lawmakers were messing
            with internet and turning into a pile of garbage we call internet
            today. All in the name of "Saving children" or "anti-piracy". SOPA,
            PIPA and COPA acts in the US and Article 13 in Europe. They all come
            from bunch of old cunts doesn't know crap about technology and these
            laws all been heavily exploited by greedy companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            SOPA act almost destroyed the entire interned because it doesn't
            allow any website to link into any pirated content. This is like 90%
            of the internet. They can come up with whatever bullshit law they
            want but it is IMPOSSIBLE to kill piracy. Piracy is now more
            available than ever unless you live in the US and don't use VPN
            while torrenting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google nowadays is removing links that contains any pirated data.
            Google also removes many other things, you can remove your name from
            search results if you are a crooked politician and doesn't like
            people spreading information about you. Regardless of the content.
            But if you are not a normie, there are tons of other search engines
            available.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will not even talk about Youtube and its DMCA bullshit. DMCA is a
            hevily exploited law and it can bite you in the ass even if you are
            a content creator who respects the law.
          </p>
          <h2>UNWRITTEN RULES OF PIRACY</h2>
          <p>
            There are some unwritten rules of piracy every pirate should know.
          </p>
          <p>1.SEED MORE!</p>
          <p>2.Spread the information, don't be a greedy fucker.</p>
          <p>3.Support the content creators if possible.</p>
          <p>
            Of course you can do whatever the fuck you want and ignore all of
            these, this is the beauty of piracy. Remember, stop paying for shit
            that should be free, seed more and make the internet a beautiful
            place.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 16 JANUARY 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Took a couple days off from writing this blog. I published a couple
            more articles on my new website. Google doesn't seem to recognize me
            yet. It can take months maybe even a year until you get an audience.
            I put so much effort into research, I am just hoping I did not waste
            my time doing this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I woke up totally refreshed and I feel great. If I don't scew
            up I am gonna spend all day being productive. I am planning to learn
            more and get a couple more websites up and running in a few months.
            I am trying to get into freelancing but situation in there is kinda
            depressing. It is not gonna be easy. Getting recognition is hard. I
            am planning to have a couple decent projects before I try that. I
            hope you enjoyed my giant dump of word soup today. I am avoiding to
            write a huge mess like this but sometimes I can't stop talking about
            certain things.
