        <h1>I AM BACK</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            It's been more than 11 days since i posted something. Things were
            not good for me. I was dealing with severe anxiety and i did not
            leave my room for 11 days straight. I didn't do much in that period
            of time other than staying in bed. I cannot lie, I even had some
            suicidal thoughts. I went back to smoking. I had horrible sleep
            schedule. One day i couldn't sleep the other day i couldn't wake up.
            But things are ok now. I got my motivation back. I was having a
            really hard time convincing myself i can do it. I just realized I am
            worried about problems that doesn't exist. I don't only have a
            couple months to learn how to be a web developer. I have a couple
            years at least. Even then i won't end up being homeless if i cannot
            find a job. I was stressing myself out for no reason. And i have
            some clearer goals now. I am gonna learn about front end before i
            start doing other stuff. I really want to start working on real
            projects as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have some good news. I was finally able to fix my sleep, i
            wake up early in the morning everyday at the same time. It was like
            this for last few days. And if things doesn't go wrong i will start
            working out again. I assume it is gonna fix some of my problems at
            least. I blame my sedentary life style for half of my depression. I
            will also start eating healtier. I gotta start from somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            When i started this project i promised giving 90 blog posts. I will
            keep my promise. I will end this project after I done posting 90
            articles/posts/whatever you want to call it. Not sure how many
            people are reading these but the days I post something here are the
            days i am more productive than usual. I will keep posting my stuff
            with my broken english but this time without skipping a day.
