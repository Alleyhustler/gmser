        <h1>MEANING OF LIFE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            The ultimate question. Why we are here? Many lives has been wasted
            trying to answer that question. Many religions built upon it. Many
            Buddhist monks spent their lives in celibacy to find a reason in
            universe. Maybe the answer was hiding inside what they were
            avoiding, pussy. Maybe world does revolve around pussy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think searching for a reason in universe is a privilege belongs to
            modern human. If you could ask a hunter-gatherer living 100.000
            years ago what is the purpose of life, he would probably say that
            "What purpose motherfucker? You hunt, you eat, you shit, you fuck
            and then you die, that's about it". Primitive people figured it all
            out. They knew their places. That's really what's up. Sedentary
            lifestyle spoiled us into thinking that we are special and we must
            be here for a reason. Bitch, you came into existence just yesterday
            and you think that you serve a great purpose in this massive
            universe that is gonna outlive humans? This is prime example of
            arrogance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really have a soft spot for primitive religions. Specially
            Mesopotamian religions. Primitive religions usually aren't human
            centred. They usually preach we are equals to animals and we are a
            part of nature instead of being masters of nature. For some reason
            they feel very sincere. First time I read Epic of Gilgamesh I got
            goosebumps. The death of Enkidu almost made me cry. As a wretched
            heretic I think that every religion offers some lessons to learn.
            Mesopotamian religions are superior to their successors, Abrahamic
            religions. At least in certain ways. They observed the nature and
            conceptualized their gods based on how nature treats them. The
            father of all gods, Zeus equivalent of Sumerian gods Enlil hated
            mankind. He convinced other gods to genocide humans and he struck
            people with a massive flood. One of the gods named Enki had sympathy
            for humans and warned a guy named Utnapishtim. He made him prepare
            for the flood by building a giant ship and saving some animals along
            the way. Same old Abrahamic story except the original trilogy was
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            They really understood the duality of nature. Sometimes kind,
            sometimes horrifying. Sometimes generous, sometimes stingy. Nature
            sometimes offers food sometimes tries to murder us. Just like
            Sumerian gods. The earth is mother, the sky is father. Just like
            Enki and Enlil. One is god of earth, other is god of sky and
            thunder. Earth, pretty much like a mother, is fertile and generous.
            Sky, just like a father, fertilizes the earth to give us food also
            when he gets angry he doesn't feel shy to punish us with thunder and
            storm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sumerians were really interesting people. They did not only invent
            the civilization but also perfected it. Arguably they were far more
            civilized than many of today's nations. Also they figured out
            everything. What life is all about. How there is no way of escaping
            from death. King Gilgamesh in his journey seeks a cure for mortality
            after losing his best friend Enkidu. Questions why people die and
            how he can stop that. He travels all the way to the end of the
            world. Meets up with Utnapishtim to find the secret of immortality.
            He listens to him talk about the great flood and how gods gave him
            immortality just because they felt guilty. After Utnapishtim
            finishes his story he talks about the plant of immortality.
            Gilgamesh in the hopes of finding a cure for aging, goes after that
            plant. After picking up the plant he loses it to a snake while he
            was asleep. And realizes that immortality and eternal youth is
            beyond his reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the way to his city Uruk, Gilgamesh comes to a realization.
            Everything that is living meant to die and rot. The meaning of life.

            Another day of staying up all night and feeling like shit throughout
            the morning until I fall asleep in the afternoon. For weeks I cannot
            get a good sleep. Cannot stay awake either. My brain is working half
            capacity. I need to fix that shit as soon as possible. For last 7 or
            8 years I was living between two phases. I suffer from insomnia for
            a couple months then after that I suffer from oversleeping a couple
            months. It is an endless cycle. I decided to take a couple days off
            from writing and focus on my future plan. I spent some time writing
            plenty of stuff. I will share them in the future. I need solid 5
            days of hard work to get some shit done.
