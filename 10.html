        <h1>MY EXPERIENCE WITH ALCOHOL</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Its been almost 2 years since i got drunk. I never was an alcoholic
            or anything but i had some bad experince with alcohol. I almost
            killed myself with homemade prison wine i made in my closet. It was
            the second time i was making that shit. It was suppose to be apple
            cider. I say suppose to because i put crapload of sugar and yeast in
            it and ended up getting 4 liters of 10% alcohol moonshine. And ended
            up drinking it all. God fucking damn i almost killed myself with
            that shit. And that taste, ugh. I still remember that disgusting
            taste. I ended up getting away with turning my room upside down and
            giving myself a week long diarrhea. And i ended up cutting myself
            with broken shards. Both intentionally and unintentionally. I got
            some nasty cuts on my feet by accidentally stepping on stupid glass
            bottle i broke. And ended up giving myself a cut in the wrist. I
            don't know what my stupid drunk ass was thinking. I threw myself out
            in the middle of that night and hurt my ankle so bad. I was a
            trainwreck at the end of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            This wasn't the first time i got into trouble with alcohol. I used
            to have a friend in highschool. We were drinking together every once
            in a while. That stupid asshole had a motorcycle. One day we wanted
            to drink in a deserted hospital. It was a totally empty hospital
            full of chemicals and shit. And our drunk asses thought it would be
            a good idea to pay a visit to the morgue. We found nothing but
            bottles of chemicals and bunch of medical waste. I was so lucky i
            did not get ebola or some shit. And at the same day this drunk idiot
            dropped me to the home with his motorcyle. Moments before he was
            trying to fuck a goddamn tree. Yes, he was humping a tree, he was
            that drunk. Never ever let a drunk highschool kid give you a
            motorcycle ride. I don't know what the hell i was thinking at the
            moment. This same idiot once almost crashed when we were riding. And
            he wasn't even drunk at that moment. Now imagine his riding skills
            when he was drunk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once i was drinking with that same friend in his house. He ended up
            showing me the pistol he got from his grandpa. He told me it shoots
            only blank cartridges. It doesn't have real bullets in it. With that
            in mind we were acting like total idiots. We got really drunk and
            started to play with that gun. We were shooting it outside, pointing
            it to each other. After we went inside he pulled out the magazine.
            It was that moment i realized it was a fully loaded gun with real
            bullets. I can say i literally dodged a bullet that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have crapload of experince with cheap wine. I almost love the
            taste. I heard from many people that it tastes disgusting but for
            some reason i love the taste of cheap crappy wine. I was drinking
            that type of shit every once in a while throughout my highschool
            years. You know there is something fucked up with the wine when you
            can buy a 1.5 liter of it for the price of a can of beer. That
            rotten taste, that sharp alcohol burning your throat, there is
            something i really like about it. Maybe because of the nostalgia i
            have for such thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all that experience with alcohol i decided to cut it off
            completely. I decided not to drink ever again. Now i only drink some
            beer every once in a while. But honestly i can live without beer
            too. If you have any addiction i hope you can find a way to get rid
            of that soon. I cannot imagine getting addicted to such horrible
            thing. Once you get hooked real bad, you cannot even quit that
            easily, it can even kill you. And alcohol makes your misery 10 times
            worse if you are drinking for some reason.

            Literally hours ago i posted the previous update. You can guess how
            much has been changed in my life. I am gonna keep this one short. My
            eyes hurts due to lack of sleep. Why the hell i do this to myself? I
            hope you all having a good day.
