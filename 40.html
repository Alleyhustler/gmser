        <h1>GREATEST CIRCUS IN THE UNIVERSE</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I want to believe. I want to believe there is a god somewhere up in
            the skies laughing his ass off because of the magnificent circus he
            created. Oh, what a wonderful shitshow the life is. We have lots of
            clowns and actors. All kinds of absurdity you can or cannot imagine.
            If life itself would be a movie it would get roasted by fart
            sniffing movie critics for being too absurd. Life is like a drama
            with lots and lots of comedy and absurdity mixed in.
          </p>
          <p>
            A guy kills a 15yo and commits all the crimes in the book. He gets
            released a couple months later. First thing he does? Stabbing a
            random woman walking down the streets, clueless about what is gonna
            happen to her. She gets stabbed to death by the guy. Guy gets jailed
            but gets his freedom not long after. Yet again. All played in the
            great circus we live in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok, check this one. A police officer rapes a woman. In a goddamn
            police car. Woman goes to police. Instead of dealing with the
            situation, other police officers silences the woman. Woman gets a
            slap in the wrist for misbehaving. Rapists gets away with it.
            Meanwhile, in another part of the world. A police officer stops a
            car. For speeding and terrorizing the traffic. He is just doing his
            job. But one thing he is not aware of, the car he just stopped
            belongs to a spoiled rich bastard whose daddy is a senator. Cop
            loses his job. Spoiled bastard's daddy gets a promotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Want to hear a horror story? Ok then. I heard this from a friend of
            mine. A young girl kills her mother, skins her, chops her up into
            pieces, cuts her head off and boils it down in a deep pot and eats
            it. She gets released for being mentally ill and therefore not being
            eligible for punishment. No newspaper talks about this. It doesn't
            make it to the headlines, nobody talks about it, nobody knows about
            it. Just a friend of my friend and a couple other people. Think
            about all the Ted Bundies we are living with. All the psychopaths
            you are not aware of. All the horrendous crimes flying under the
            radar.
          </p>
          <h2>Fun Part of The World</h2>
          <p>
            Among all the countries, 3rd world shitholes are my favorite ones.
            If you are living in a first world country with no problems you
            cannot imagine all the fun you were missing. All the absurdity, all
            the cruelty, all the entertainment 3rd world shitholes can offer.
            They are the most entertaining places on earth. Reading about stuff
            happening in 3rd world countries alone can make you realize how big
            of a shitshow the entire life is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a country where government is running drugs and drug users
            are getting jailed. Oh, sweet irony. But wait, there is even a
            funnier one. Imagine a countryâ€¦ A country where people talking about
            illegal drugs gets jailed but government itself has a deep
            relationship with drug dealers. Somebody should tell them marketing
            is good for their business. And check this one out. In the same
            country, you don't get jailed right off the bat for using drugs, but
            you get your ass jailed for praising those same drugs. Hahahahahaha!
            Selling drugs is ok, using them is ok, talking bout them is a big no
            no!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now think about a country that is being ruled by thieves and
            traitors and these thieves don't even hide it. People voted for the
            king of all these thieves knows that he is a total piece of shit but
            they vote for him anyways. Imagine this same guy fucks up the
            economy by his own hands and people just act like nothing is wrong.
            They call you a traitor for complaining too much about the current
            state of economy. Even though the fucker getting his ass licked by
            these clowns admits that he is responsible for everything. Welcome
            to the 3rd world.
          </p>
          <h2>The Saga of Banana Republic</h2>
          <p>
            Now, check this out. In a country called Banana Republic, government
            has deep roots into religious cults. They place cult members into
            all parts of the bureaucracy. Cult members starts to occupy most
            critical jobs in Banana Republic. All judges are cult members, all
            police officers are cult members, all soldiers are cult members. You
            don't support this mighty cult and thinking their actions are
            questionable? Good luck doing business in Banana Republic. They
            attack you with all sorts of disgusting slander and they do their
            best to ruin your business. This one cult has a mighty leader.
            People of Banana Republic loves their cult leader. Their prime
            minister is nothing but his puppet, his worshiper. Everyone is
            praising this mighty prophet and those who don't, loses their jobs
            and even get jailed for bullshit crimes that hasn't even been
            committed.
          </p>
          <p>
            And one day supreme leader of Banana Republic thinks to himself, he
            is nothing short of a prophet himself. He doesn't need that cult
            leader. He needs more power. He wants it all. He deems that false
            prophet a traitor and starts to fight against his followers. Once a
            great worshiper becomes a false prophet himself. Despite his past
            with the cult leader of great Banana Republic, despite empowering
            this false prophet and his followers himself for decades, despite
            jailing patriotic people of Banana Republic for not worshiping his
            prophet and replacing them with spineless asslickers, he gets all
            the credit for saving his country from this evil and treacherous
            cult. People call him a hero. They love him even more now for all of
            his service for Banana Republic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Funniest part of all? This supreme leader of Banana Republic once
            was a beloved man by the western media. They sucked his dick and
            swallowed his cum until the last drop. Thanks to western media
            praising the hell out of spineless leader of Banana Republic and
            their now infamous cult leader, Banana Republic prospered. Banana
            Republic got showered with all kinds of investment and their leader
            gained incredible amount of political power. Now he got rid of the
            false prophet and became the true king of his own empire, western
            media suddenly changed its attitude. Suddenly they realized supreme
            leader of Banana republic is nothing but a bloody dictator. And the
            false prophet, the mastermind behind all of this shit, the entire
            reason why dictator of Banana Republic became a man of power instead
            of a common wage slave, still living his life inside fortified
            walls. Protected by the mightiest of all first world countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            And while 3rd world shitholes are tearing themselves apart, citizens
            of the first world, people watching this great circus from the back
            seats are fighting over the stupidest shit one can imagine. Their
            biggest misery is a bigot misgendering them or people refusing to
            use whatever retarded pronouns they gave to themselves. Biggest
            problem in the world is the racist, sexist, misogynistic language
            called English. They have problems with pronouns and gender specific
            words. Like we ran out of problems in the goddamn world. Zoomers
            living in the center of attention thinks to themselves they are
            saving the world with the power of keyboard. They are modern day
            thinkers, philosophers, scholars and prophets. All thanks to mighty
            twitter. Every problem on earth seems to be solved by a flag. A new
            age political ideology is solution to everything. They even point
            their fingers at dirty 3rd world dwellers for destroying the nature
            with their dirty industries. Sorry for not being able to afford a
            Tesla and destroying the nature with our cheap, dirty gasoline cars
            from the stone age. Sorry for eating meat, we don't have the same
            moral standards. We cannot exactly afford shelves full of
            supplements and fancy vegan food. Sorry that we are heating our
            houses using dirty fossil fuel and cooking with gas instead of
            induction cookers. Electricity isn't exactly cheap in here. We sure
            disappointed Greta Thunberg didn't we?
          </p>
          <h2>Darwin Awards</h2>
          <p>
            Good thing we have Darwin Awards. Greatest of all clowns is the one
            wastes himself for the entertainment of the crowd after all. Oh
            wait, it is not an official award yet. What a shame. Because
            whenever I see a retard cleaning himself out of the gene pool I
            laugh my ass off. Another form of entertainment in the greatest
            circus of the entire universe. I heard about people trying to put
            down a fire using an oxygen tank used for welding and exploding
            themselves. I heard about a retard trying to flush down a hand
            grenade and destroying his hand. I heard about friends pulling a
            prank on one of their friends by shoving down a goddamn air hose
            into his arsehole and pumping pressurized air inside his intestines
            and killing him. Who needs enemies when you have friends, right? And
            guys smuggling drugs inside a condom located in their rear trunk.
            You should watch the shitshow happens after that condom explodes and
            guy starts overdosing slowly from anal ingestion. Heard countless
            stories like that and seen one video on the internet. What a way to
            die.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gun accidents are my favorite though. There is nothing funnier than
            seeing a guy with a split open face because of an accidental shotgun
            discharge. Or a retarded ass cop shooting himself in the foot while
            demonstrating gun safety. You have seen this video. Or, how about
            retards trying to use a fully automatic rifle for the first time and
            shooting themselves because of the muzzle climb? But the most
            hilarious ones are always the ones occurring during a gunfight. I
            have seen a guy shouldering an LMG and thinking he is John Rambo but
            gets his head turned into a popcorn in seconds by a sniper shooting
            down the hill.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are thinking to yourself I lost my goddamn mind. Maybe I did. I
            fucking take nothing seriously anymore. God himself created the life
            for his own goddamn enjoyment. We are nothing but fucktoys in his
            cruel game. You can do nothing but trying to enjoy the shitshow and
            take nothing seriously. Suddenly, anything is a form of
            entertainment. One man's misery another man's joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            And dear god, if you hear me. I have nothing against you. Thank you
            for this magnificent shitshow you have created. If I was a god, I
            would do the same. I wouldn't change a damn thing in this world. I
            would even poke some people time to time to make them lose their
            minds to intensify the shitshow. Life is as amusing as it gets. If
            there is a religion where people accepts that god is one massive
            troll, I am gonna worship their god. I will end up being the most
            conservative believer of that religion. But all religions are
            selling you the same "all-mighty, all-knowing, justice loving god"
            bullshit. To me, a god who is taking humans seriously isn't worthy
            of my respect. Have you ever seen a lion talking to a lizard? We are
            nothing but bunch of insects compared to god. God doesn't have any
            moral obligations. He can do whatever the fuck he wants with the
            circus monkeys he created.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 23 AUGUST 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            After weeks of insomnia and a few days of horrible fever I finally
            managed to get some nice sleep. Sleep is the sweetest thing in the
            world. If I could pick one superpower I would pick the ability of
            sleeping and waking up whenever I want. Don't fuck with your sleep
            frens. Sleep is steroids for your brain. Sleep is nutrition for your
            memory. God, you cannot imagine how shitty I was feeling last few
            weeks. I could get maybe 3-4 hours of half assed sleep a day.
            Sometimes no sleep at all.
