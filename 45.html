        <article>
          <p>
            I can see the light. Shinning from a distance, very dimly. I cannot
            put the pieces together but the puzzle is complete enough to make me
            think my demise is very close. Maybe I am a pessimist, or maybe a
            realist. This is pretty vague for now. I am totally screwed and last
            remaining hope I had is slowly slipping off my hands. I once
            believed anxiety is a made up illness, now I am suffering from the
            most extreme form of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            How one can fuck up this badly? I wasn't the unluckiest person on
            earth. Cannot claim that I born under the most horrid circumstances. I had
            multiple chances to save myself. I could start a new life, I could
            build myself a somewhat decent career even though I am some sort of
            a retard. Mental retardation is prominent in my lineage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always questioned myself despite some compliments I got from those
            around me. It is easy to hide your stupidity. A couple fancy words,
            talking about random lesser known subjects and everyone thinks you
            are an intellectual. But deep down I knew that I am mediocre at
            best. Maybe I gave up too early on my passions. People always said I
            have somewhat decent artistic talent and I should become an artist
            or something. I believed that for a while until I realized shit I
            draw is total garbage. They said I have talent for sports and I
            should become an athlete or something. I believed that too until I
            realized I am not blessed by optimal genetics for sports. I was just
            your average gymbro. I had a thing with words as well, you cannot
            see it from the garbage I dump in here. But I could speak well with
            a lot of confidence. But all I was saying was some nonsense. Had no
            real talent for anything. I was just a mediocre kid leaving an
            impression on below mediocre people. It is easy to make yourself
            believe you are special because most people has no passion and
            doesn't put any effort into anything. You can convince them you are
            talented. They don't know that you are worthless in the eyes of a
            true professional. They are not really involved in your hobbies to
            realize your cheap tricks are nothing compared to what others can
            do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made my peace with mediocrity that's not the problem. I just don't
            have enough time anymore. And situation is hopeless in my country.
            It is just a matter of time I find myself on streets. I lied to my
            parents. I told them I will finish the school this year, they will
            probably realize this was a bullshit sooner or later. They will see
            that I did not even try. It won't happen. I thought that would buy
            me some time to get a job. The goal was to build myself a career in
            the field of computers. I now have a couple months until the
            semester. And I have an ocean full of challenges. Doesn't seem
            plausible to me that I can save myself from this situation. One
            minor problem can fuck up everything forever. I cannot afford to get
            sick, I cannot afford losing this garbage laptop I use, I cannot
            afford having a week off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting a dead end job is out of question. Not that I cannot
            withstand some hard labor. The unemployment rates in my country is
            just unbelievable. And once I put myself in that position, there is
            no way of turning back. I won't have time to put some effort into
            learning and building a career on web business. Once I become a
            wagie I will remain a wagie until end of my life. And there is the
            fact that the minimum wage doesn't even cover the costs of living.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really don't know what to do. I just want to run. Run as fast as I
            can until I die out of exhaustion. I want to run until I reach to
            the end of the world. I want to run like the death itself is chasing
            me. I want to throw myself out and run, with no shoes, with no
            clothes, until the light goes out.

        <h2 class="date">DAILY UPDATE - 14 OCTOBER 2022</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Not much of an update but I remembered the day I almost posined
            myself with my homemade wine. I don't remember being that drunk at
            any other point of my life. I cut myself on the wrist with a piece
            of broken glass then left the house with some nasty wounds on my
            wrists. I was walking outside in the middle of the night. I can
            vaguely remember that day. I was running and I can remember the
            street lights and some random faces. I also stumbled and fucked up
            my ankle. Couldn't walk for a couple weeks. That's about it. I
            thought that was the lowest point of my life. Oh, how wrong I was.
