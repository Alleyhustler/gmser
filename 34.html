        <h1>I SAW MY TEENAGE SELF TODAY</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            It is early in the morning and I was awake all night. Decided to
            take a walk, maybe talk to some random people. I was always a big
            idiot when it comes to ending a conversation but had no problem
            talking to any kind of people. Young, old, stupid, smart, people
            with bad mouth, people with cloutâ€¦ Been a long time since I actually
            talked to someone. But anyways, I don't actually have any social
            anxiety so I talked to random people. Mostly young ones, teenagers.
            Crazy how all they talk is how to get a job, how to make money
            easily, how to leave the sinking ship. I remember my teenage years,
            it wasn't this bad. All we talked about were stupid shit like
            videogames and sports. Living in a 3rd world shithole in the break
            of a collapse has side effects like this I guess. After talking to
            various kinds of people I hit the road. My destination was unclear.
            I was just walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I needed money but had none in my pocket, so I decided to find an
            ATM so I can go buy something to drink. After I did withdraw my
            money, I realized my old high school is nearby. I only spent the
            first year of high school in there, my memories of it are not so
            clear. Decided why not, why shouldn't I pay a visit to see how it
            looks today. And oh man how different it looks from the outside.
            Took me some time to even find the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have seen a group of high school kids coming towards me. I asked
            if it is last day of the school, they said yes. They didn't seem to
            understand what a guy looking like a horse thief from wild west is
            doing in their school. I walked some more, there were 4 kids sitting
            on a bench and talking. I approached them. Asked if it is ok for me
            to take a look inside the school. They asked who am I willing to
            see. I said I graduated more than 5 years ago and just wanted to
            take a look inside. One of them asked "Did you miss your old
            school?". The answer was so obvious but I just said "No, not really,
            I am just walking by". We had a little chit chat, talked about my
            high school days. Talked about all the funny memories, talked about
            the teachers and how the school building has changed over the years.
            Learned that none of my teachers working there anymore. We sat there
            and talked for roughly 15 minutes before I decided to go inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entrance seemed different. It was solid 8 years ago at least
            when I was a freshman year student. Of course it does change. Walked
            up the stairs. While I was walking, suddenly my memories kicked in.
            I have found myself in my old classroom in the 2nd floor. When I
            walked in everything looked the same. All the desks even all the
            carvings on them were sitting in there. I have found my old desk and
            sat there. Moments later my old friends started filling the room. I
            could hear them talking, could not tell what they were saying but I
            could see them all around me. All those faces suddenly appeared out
            of thin air but couldn't remember a single name. My old teacher was
            there, sitting on her desk changing the pages of a notebook or
            something. She doesn't seem to care all the noise all around her. A
            few moments later a tall chubby kid walked in. His shoelaces were
            sweeping the floor, he was messy as hell. He was wearing this baggy
            school uniform. Despite being in the middle of a summer he was
            wearing that stupid blue jacket and sweater. He directly walked
            towards me and sat next to me. He was complaining about some stupid
            shit. His grades, stupid problems he had with his family, some
            asshole friends of his. I listened to him until he stopped talking.
            Busted out a smirky laughter and said lets just leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            The yard was already empty. We walked and walked. He did not say
            much and I did not want to disturb the silence. We jumped out the
            fence and took a shortcut to the internet cafe I used to go. We ran
            away from that gigantic dog chasing us every single time after
            landing the other side of the iron fence with sharp spikes. We could
            spend extra 5 minutes and take the long route, but this was more
            fun. We spent some time playing Counter Strike 1.6. We both sucked
            at FPS games but kept playing it anyways. Only if my nerdy friend
            planning to be a professional CS player was there to play with us.
            Later we decided to eat something. Stopped by a small fast food
            shop, ate a couple sandwiches. Just like I did every single day when
            I was a freshman. I got diarrhea so many times after eating there.
            But kept doing it anyways because all the kids were eating there.
            After finishing the sandwiches we hit the road again. We walked past
            all the narrow roads I used to walk. Stopped by a park. Just like me
            and my friends used to sit there and talk. I lit up a cigarette. He
            didn't want to smell like cigarettes, otherwise his parents could
            think that he is smoking. He was sitting on a bench next to me. Sun
            was shooting down its beautiful orange beams on the clouds, birds
            were chirping, not a single human being is on the sight. None of us
            dare to disturb this beautiful scene. We sat there for a while. None
            of us ever talked all this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            He finally broke the silence and asked. "So tell me, how you ended
            up like this?". Had nothing to say. Didn't know where the childhood
            ended and the adulthood started. What the hell went wrong, how all
            that time has passed. So I said nothing. He understood. After I
            finished my cigarette, we stood up and I said goodbye to my old
            self. "Are we gonna see each other?" I asked. "No, I have things to
            do" he said and walked back to his school while I am standing there
            watching him disappear into nothingness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weather changed from warm afternoon with the orange sun to dark
            cloudy Friday morning. The internet cafe I used to go is now gone,
            same as the fast food shop. School is surrounded by tall concrete
            walls and plenty of new buildings, no more puny ass iron fence and
            an easy way to flee. And all my friends turned back into my memories
            where they remain the same even after all those years. They just
            look like as I remember them. Some of them visit me in my dreams
            time to time.

        <article>
          <p>
            It is official now. I am a wage slave. It is manual labor kind of
            job and it is damn tiring. Been two days since I started. It is my
            first job. I worked here and there to help people ever since my
            childhood but never got a salary. I won't have as much time so I
            might not be able deliver blog posts for next couple months. I start
            working early in the morning and leave until the sun beats.
            Sometimes I will work until the midnight. Sometimes for a couple
            days. Sometimes I won't work at all for short periods of times. It
            is a nightmare job. I carry some heavy ass equipment for a small
            business. Sometimes I become a janitor, sometimes a construction
            worker, sometimes a cleaner, sometimes a technician. I hope I can
            find enough time to study because I did not leave my dream of
            becoming a web developer. I won't complain much about my newly
            earned job. Experience is experience and life is all about
            experience. Bad ones sometimes can be more beneficial. Only time
            will tell what kind of experience I will get out of this.
