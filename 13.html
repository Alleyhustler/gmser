        <h1>LIFE HACKS THAT WORKS!</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            "Life hacks" became a meme at this point, retarded ass youtube
            channels shove their stupid compliation videos down to your throat,
            you keep seeing articles about how can you solve all your problems
            with a bit of duct tape and literal trash. However there are a few
            simple hacks i know that are useful for me.
          </p>
          <h2>COLD SHOWERS</h2>
          <p>
            For about 2 moths i am only taking ice cold showers at the morning
            to wake up. And it really works. It gives you energy, good for your
            health and even sharpens your mind. You probably heard about this
            but maybe you don't buy it. Trust me, cold shower or better an ice
            bath is the best way to start a day. It increases the blood flow and
            does some other stuff to the brain. Opens you up for learning. Cold
            in general is not your enemy. It doesn't necessarily make you sick.
            I have even seen people putting ice onto their balls to increase
            testosterone levels. This is a bit too much for me and have no idea
            if it really works. But i will keep taking ice cold showers in rest
            of my life.
          </p>
          <h2>POWER NAPPING</h2>
          <p>
            Power napping is just sleeping for short period of time. It should
            end between 10 to 20 minutes, in maximum 30 minutes. Just before
            deep sleep. You probably heard about this too. However type of power
            napping I do is after chugging a cup of strong coffee, coffe that
            has consistency of hot asphalt. I drink my coffee just before taking
            the nap and i wake up like i got struck by lightning. If you drink
            coffee before a short nap there is no way it is gonna last longer
            than 30 minutes. You don't even need to set an alarm. When i first
            heard about this i thought it is just another nonesense "life
            hacking" thing. But after i tried it myself i convinced it is pretty
            useful. I wouldn't consume coffee before taking a real sleep. But in
            this case you fall asleep before caffeine gets into your blood
            stream and wake up just before your body fully infuses it. The way
            caffeine works is, it binds into adenosine receptors in brain and
            rivaling against adenosine and makes you feel energetic. At least
            this is what i heard. Of course it does many other stuff. Napping
            after coffee consumption works really well because napping lowers
            the adenosine and caffeine can bind into more receptors. I am not
            sure if i screwed up the scientific background of this but i don't
            care what hapens at the background. Only thing i can say, it works
            like a charm. You are gonna jump off the bed after your short nap
            and feel energetic at the rest of the day. This works really well
            specially if you need to sleep but can't for some reason. If you at
            least have some time to take a quick nap just try this. You won't
            regret.
          </p>
          <h2>POMODORO TECHNIQUE</h2>
          <p>
            You probably heard this countless times before, it is not magic, it
            is not something special, it is not life changing or anything but it
            is something i use all the time. If you don't know what pomodoro
            technique is, it is a technique to increase your productivity. It
            won't fix it if you don't have any productivity to begin with but it
            is good for studying. It is basically a time management system. You
            work for 25 minutes take a 5 minute rest work another 25 minutes and
            5 minute rest. Each interval is called a pomodoro. After working
            like 3 hours you take a big rest, something like an hour. You all
            probably know this technique due to it is being preached by "life
            coaches" for decades. This is one of the few techniques about
            productivity that is somewhat useful. Give it a try if you never
            used it.

        <article>
          <p>
            Not much to say today. It was too damn hot, i ended up wasting time
            with a lot of chores and wasted some more time watching youtube,
            reading news and talking with online friends and without even
            realising the day is over.
